  The Crystal Palace at Sydenham ... commenced its career with the
  highest aspirations. The British Public were to be shown the
  architectural glories of the Alhambra and Pompeii, and soon found
  themselves watching the evolutions of Léotard and Blondin. In
  like manner the Westminster Aquarium was inaugurated by the Duke
  of Edinburgh, as a sort of supplement to "the mission of Albert
  the Good," but soon had to fall back on Zazel and a "Variety
  entertainment."

_Punch_ accordingly prophecies a similar evolution in the character of
the South Kensington Exhibition, and the sequel proved that here, at
any rate, he was a true prophet.

Students of Criminology will find much to interest them in _Punch's_
pages during this period. We have already seen that he had abandoned
his objection to capital punishment in the 'sixties. Commenting on the
debate in June, 1877, _Punch_ defended the maintenance of the gallows
as an _ultima ratio legum_--much on the lines of J. S. Mill, who had,
more than anyone else, converted him from his old view. Later on, when
the abolition was rejected by 263 votes to 64, he writes:--

  We keep our gallows for the brute whom no rope weaker than the hempen
  halter will bind, and no terror less terrible than Tyburn Tree will
  hold in awe. There are such ruffians; and for them the gallows is, and
  will be, kept for the present standing.

In 1879 the trial of Peace, the murderer, gave _Punch_ a good opening
for condemning the undue prominence given in the Press to the
personalities and tastes of criminals. He makes a good point against
papers which speak with two voices: filling their news columns with
personal details of murderers and denouncing the cult of the criminal
in their leading articles. Such inconsistencies, however, still
continue to grieve the judicious. In the early 'eighties the urbane
inefficiency of the Police Force, and especially of the detective side,
is a frequent theme of criticism, both burlesque and serious. The most
amusing entry relates to a constable alleged to have reported: "At 1.45
this morning, found an earthquake opposite No. 207." _Punch_ christened
the C.I.D. the "Defective Police," but proved his impartiality by
handsomely admitting the heavy odds against which constables had to
contend--the truncheon was no match for the burglar's revolver.

[Sidenote: _Crime in Whitechapel_]

Frequent allusions to hooliganism and armed burglars occur in 1882.
_Punch_ speaks of a "Mohock Revival," and asks, "Is the Police Force no
remedy, or must we all carry revolvers?" For a while complaints against
the impotence of the police cease, or take a new form, as when _Punch_
turns his attention to the disgraceful conditions prevailing at the
Central Criminal Court, where respectable men and women subpoenaed
as witnesses were exposed to hustling and insults from roughs--and
constables. In 1887 he extended his censure to the shocking condition
of the prisons in which unconvicted prisoners were lodged awaiting
trial. For the conduct of the police during the Jubilee Celebrations he
has nothing but praise, and waxed lyrical in "_Punch_ to the Peelers"
over their humanity and courtesy.

But a far more severe ordeal awaited the police in 1888, the year of
the crime wave in Whitechapel. Sarcastic allusions to the inefficiency
of the Force are renewed. One cartoon represents them blindfolded
and stumbling about amongst jeering criminals. _Punch_ was nearer
the mark in the cartoon headed, "The Nemesis of Neglect"--based on
a letter from "S. G. O." in _The Times_ pointing out that East End
slums invited crime--and in his admissions that the numbers of the
police were inadequate and that their inefficiency was largely due to
the publicity given to the movements of detectives, and the measures
taken by the authorities, by sensational interviewers in the cheap
press. The amateur "crime investigator" unfortunately continued to
flourish in spite of _Punch's_ censure. Hideous picture-posters,
vividly representing sensational scenes of murder, exhibited as the
"great attractions" of certain plays, are also condemned as a blot on
civilization, a disgrace to the Drama, and a suggestion of crime. It
should be added that _Punch_ expressly exempted Sir Charles Warren from
blame, and indignantly dissociated himself from the attacks of those
who joined in making him a scapegoat:--

  The Police Force requires strengthening, and Sir Charles is perfectly
  alive to the fact. What on earth can it matter if, in number, our
  Police compare favourably with the Police Force at Constantinople,
  or St. Petersburgh, or Vienna, or Jericho, if we have not sufficient
  Police to protect life and property in the Metropolis? Socialistic
  sensational Journalists and rowdy demagogues would like to see the
  Police Force reduced to one in every two thousand, until they fell to
  fighting among themselves, when they would be the first to yell out
  "Police!" and scream for the intervention of the enfeebled arm of the
  law.

In April, 1889, the proposed flogging of dangerous criminals excited
a good deal of controversy. In _Punch's_ cartoon in April Bill
Sikes protests as an injured innocent against the cat on the ground
that it will make a brute of him. _Punch's_ attitude was strongly
anti-sentimentalist, but he held that the lash should be used with
discretion.

In the summer he renews his demand for increasing the police. The new
Chief Commissioner, Monro, is shown telling John Bull that he can have
any number of policemen _if he likes to pay for them_, while Policeman
X, Junior, declares that the Force is overworked. It is curious to
note that, in the list of police difficulties, besides Whitechapel
murders, _Punch_ includes the control of Salvation Army processions and
obstructions. But in these days even so wise and good a man as Huxley
did not hesitate to label--and libel--Salvationism as "Corybantic
Christianity."

On the everlasting Drink Question _Punch_ sided with the moderate
reformers, disapproved of coercion or Prohibition, and found
confirmation of his views in the testimony of the Howard Association in
1876 that moral persuasion and improvement in the conditions of living
afforded the only real remedy. Recreation, as an alternative to and
distraction from the public-house, he always advocated. When the Sunday
opening of galleries and museums was again rejected in 1879, _Punch's_
cartoon took his familiar line that Sabbatarianism drove men to drink.
"Bung" congratulates Archbishop Tait on the support of the Episcopal
bench in defeating the measure. But in the same month, in "Friend
Bung's Remonstrance," _Punch_ inserted a protest against the notion
that all public-housekeepers would support Sabbatarian legislation.
That he was sensitive to foreign criticism is shown by his skit on M.
Millaud's articles in the _Figaro_ in 1880 in which the drunkenness of
London had been unfavourably commented upon.

[Sidenote: _Licensing Anomalies_]

The "marvellous magisterial licensing system" of the period, which was
"vexatious, inconsistent, and meddlesome," is repeatedly criticized
in the year. In an article on the degeneracy of the Aquarium, _Punch_
gives a full account of its vulgar, inane, and sensational shows, and
alludes to the nocturnal orgies enacted at that place of entertainment.
Music and dancing licences, he declared, would be applied for by the
ten thousand if there were freedom and wisdom, instead of the chaos and
vested interest maintained by "Maw-worm" and "Meddlevex" (Middlesex)
magistrates. The result was that London was "a city of unmitigated
pot-houses." Yet drinking, judged by the test of state finance, was
decreasing. The revenue from intoxicants in 1882 had fallen 2½
millions in seven years, and _Punch_ indulges in ironical comment.
The picture in the spring of 1883 of the "Temperance Budget" shows
the financial conditions of the country as only fairly satisfactory,
and represents John Bull as saying: "I have been too sober--_Nunc est
bibendum_." This was obviously ironical, but it was irony that might
easily be misread. _Punch_ would probably have endorsed Archbishop
Magee's famous dictum: "Better England free than England sober."
Teetotalism was to _Punch_ inextricably associated with cranks,
faddists, and fanatics. He was a robust humanitarian. Cock-fighting was
a barbarous pastime, but he resented the unfair differentiation which
punished working men who indulged in it with a heavy fine, while rich
and aristocratic pigeon-shooters went scot-free. Dr. Carver's shooting
performances at the Crystal Palace in 1879 are specially praised
because he did not exhibit his skill by the slaughter of pigeons. So
in 1876 _Punch_ had supported Mr. Flower's agitation against the use
of bearing-reins for horses. Cruelty to animals he detested; but, on
the burning question of vivisection, firmly upheld the practice, in the
interests of humanity, when guarded by stringent regulations, and sided
with Lister and Paget against Lord Shaftesbury, whose opposition he
deeply regretted.

[Illustration: HAPPY THOUGHT--A "SUNDAY SCHOOL FOR THE UPPER CLASSES"

(_Vide Bishop of Oxford's Speech at the Church Congress_)

ELIZABETH WARING (_Laundress and Charwoman, and Sunday School
Teacher to the U.C._): "And now, my dear little Ladies and Gentlemen,
I trust you will not _desecrate_ this beautiful Sunday Afternoon by
going on the River! You can do that from Monday Morning till Saturday
Night, you know! His Lordship here, who was at Eton and Oxford, will
no doubt _remember how the Oars he had plied so busily all the week,
lay untouched on Sunday_! And you too, my dears, will please to give up
the River, on that one day--to those who have been toiling all the busy
Week long in stifling Offices and grimy Workshops, and suchlike!"]

Wages, as I have remarked above, were still remarkably low, judged by
our post-war standards. In 1880 _Punch_ quotes an advertisement from
the _Lincoln Gazette_ for an "active young town crier and bill-poster
who can live on 1s. 3d. a week." But prices were low also, and by
the mid 'seventies cheap railway fares and excursions had led to a
great increase of travelling among the working classes. The "cheap
tripper" figures largely in _Punch_ throughout these years, and his
(and her) manners and customs lent themselves more readily to satire
than sympathy. _Punch_ was still the friend as well as the critic of
the masses, and when in 1883 the steam launch nuisance on the Thames
was exciting a good deal of inflammatory comment, published his "Sunday
School for the Upper Classes," in which a laundress and charwoman is
seen giving a lesson to young gentlefolk, turning the tables on their
Sabbatarian teaching, and asking them to give up the river on Sunday
to those who worked all the week. But here, as so often, _Punch_
showed his habitual impartiality by simultaneously admitting that the
state of the river was a scandal, and welcoming an official inquiry by
the Thames Conservancy Board. A year later he emphasized Sir Charles
Dilke's statement that the river was "a sort of savage place," with no
real police to enforce the law; _Punch's_ picture of the Thames on Bank
Holiday exhibits a carnival of rowdyism, collisions, and upsets. The
steam launch was no favourite of _Punch_. He had already shown it as an
intruder on the waterways of Venice, crowded with 'Arries and 'Arriets
emitting characteristic comments on the Bridge of Sighs.

[Illustration: THE STEAM LAUNCH IN VENICE

("Sic Transit Gloria Mundi")

'ANDSOME 'ARRIET: "Ow, my! If it 'yn't that bloomin' old
Temple Bar, as they did aw'y with out o' Fleet Street!"

MR. BELLEVILLE (_referring to Guide-book_): "Now it 'yn't!
It's the famous Bridge o' _Sighs_, as _Byron_ went and stood on; 'im as
wrote _Our Boys_, yer know!"

'ANDSOME 'ARRIET: "Well, I _never_! It 'yn't much of a _size_,
any'ow!"

MR. BELLEVILLE: "'Ear! 'Ear! Fustryte!"]

Throughout the 'eighties all the unlovely and odious attributes of
lower middle-class vulgarity were concentrated by _Punch_ in a series
of verses directed against 'Arry, who takes the place of the "snob"
and the "gent" of the 'forties and 'fifties. One sometimes wonders
whether the late Mr. Milliken, the creator of _Punch's_ 'Arry, was not
intoxicated by the exuberance of his own invention, by the deftness
of his patter, and exaggerated the atrocities of the original. For
there is no redeeming feature in 'Arry, or in 'Arriet, who is indeed
the worse of the two." ... Modesty? Meekness? Thrift? Oh, Jiminy!
Ladies of Fashion ain't caught now with no such moral niminy piminy."
Their lingo is extensive, peculiar, and unpleasant, and much of it has
mercifully passed into the limbo of lost words--"rorty," for example,
and (let us hope) "lotion" for drink. 'Arry, as depicted in these
monologues, is always the Cockney; the withers of the provincial are
unwrung in contemplating his excesses. He is sometimes a clerk, though
not of the class whose "Cry" had evoked _Punch's_ sympathy, sometimes a
counter-jumper, but always a cad. He and his partner are always drawn
in such a way as to lend point to the cynical saying that "life would
be endurable but for its amusements." His notion of pleasure is largely
made up of din and destruction. If he takes a holiday in the country,
he disturbs its sylvan seclusion by tearing up ferns and tearing
down branches. But he is in his true element at the seaside--witness
_Punch's_ gruesome adaptation of Southey's lines on Lodore, under the
heading "The Shore."

[Sidenote: _'Arry and 'Arriet_]

[Illustration: A GROUP OF 'ARRIES

In the centre of which may be seen the plain but captivating Mr.
Belleville, who explains to the lovely Miss Eliza Larkins that it's of
no consequence whether a man be handsome or not, "_so long as he looks
like a gentleman_!"]

'Arry figures in a less repulsive mood when visiting the Paris
Exhibition of 1889--"'Arry in Parry." He is very far from belonging to
the submerged classes, and has generally plenty of money to spend on
his amusements and creature comforts. But he is not enamoured of hard
work. The competition of the German clerk in 1886 fills him with fury.
He is disgusted with the "Sossidges" for ousting Englishmen from their
jobs, but is not prepared to emulate the industry of the foreigner:--

    Young Yah-Yah 'as nobbled my crib, turns his pink shovel nose up,
      old man.
    _He_ may live upon lager and langwidges, Charlie; sech isn't
      _my_ plan.

Mr. Gladstone had appealed to the Englishman to prove himself the
better man by competing with the German on the ground on which the
latter excelled. The Cockney clerk retorts that it isn't good enough,
and clamours for the expulsion of the industrious aliens who undercut
him.

Mixed up with 'Arry's selfishness, greediness, and general lack of
decency and good feeling there is a certain element of shrewdness, of
practical common sense, but it is always exerted on behalf of Number
One. Taken all round, he is easily the most disagreeable of all the
types created by _Punch_ in a period in which his former complacency
had given place, at best, to a somewhat peevish optimism, sinking at
times, as we note elsewhere, to dismal laments over our decadence.
But, in justice to _Punch_, it is right to add that by far the most
severe denunciations are reserved for the degenerates in high places.
The 'Arry poems do not show _Punch_ in the light of a Jeremiah or a
Juvenal. Taken together, they form a sort of composite photograph of
the mean Cockney who belongs neither to the classes nor the masses, who
lacks the breeding and reticence of the one and the primitive virtues
of the other. Moreover, the unabashed and undefeated complacency of
these monologues, apart from their shrewdness, inspires a certain
grudging admiration for this entirely impenitent "bounder."

[Sidenote: _Punch and the Army_]

But we part from him without regret, and with a feeling that he is
almost too odious to be true to type. He bulks so largely in the pages
of _Punch_ as to obscure the evidences of abiding friendliness to the
true democracy on which 'Arry was a mere excrescence. The manners
of the cheap tripper might offend _Punch_, but he was genuinely
delighted when bands were introduced in the Parks on Sundays to the
discomfiture of Sabbatarians and Pharisees; and we find him contrasting
the activity of the police in suppressing gambling in Bermondsey
with the tolerance extended to certain West End clubs. There was
nothing new in this attitude, but we may note a change in regard to
his views on emigration, which in earlier days _Punch_ had supported
with enthusiasm. In 1877 a curious letter, guaranteed genuine, is
published from a settler in Australia, describing the conditions there,
and strongly deterring emigration to a country where there were no
comforts, and nothing was cheaper than in England save meat.

[Illustration: TECHNICAL

"'Ellow, 'Erry! Why, 'ow _are_ yer?"

"_Eighteen Car-rat_, ole man! 'Ow's yerself?"]

In the earlier volumes of this survey it has been shown how deep-seated
was the prejudice against the Army amongst respectable middle-class
and working people. In his earlier and anti-militarist days _Punch_
had shared this feeling, and even denounced the recruiting-sergeant
as an ogre or worse. From the Crimean War onward this hostility gave
place to the wiser and saner view that the men who served their country
bravely and faithfully should be decently treated, properly fed, and
encouraged in self-respect by the community which they defended.
How far public opinion fell short in this regard may be seen in the
excellent appeal headed "Men Wanted" which _Punch_ issued in January,
1875. The Army was greatly in need of recruits, and the evidence taken
before the Recruiting Commission proved that "the want of respect shown
by civilians to Her Majesty's uniform had a great deal to do with the
Army's loss of popularity." Whereupon _Punch_ proceeds to point out:--

  1. That the intellectual training of Soldiers is now a matter of
  paramount importance, and that the Privates of many Regiments can
  compare favourably with civilians as regards education.

  2. That through the exertions of H.R.H. the Duke of Cambridge,
  Recreation Rooms and Libraries have been established in all the
  Barracks, with the object (an object that has been attained) of
  fostering refinement in the ranks.

  3. That, during the recent series of Autumn Manoeuvres, the Armies
  in the Field have gained golden opinions from all with whom they have
  come in contact.

  4. That most Soldiers, when they leave the Service, are found to be
  admirably adapted to fill the positions of clerks, railway-guards,
  policemen, and other posts of importance and responsibility.

  5. That a Colour-Sergeant is a Non-Commissioned Officer in command of
  some sixty or a hundred men, who has been promoted after many years'
  service in the ranks, in recognition of zeal, cleverness, and good
  conduct.

Having made these observations, Field-Marshal _Punch_ is forced to
record his deep regret:--

  1. That a Magistrate speaking from the Bench should have thought
  proper to inform a Recruit that to join the Army was to take a false
  step in life, which might possibly entail the breaking of his parents'
  hearts.

  2. That a Non-Commissioned Officer should be refused admission
  to the best seats in a place of public entertainment because he
  (the Non-Commissioned Officer in question) happened at the time of
  purchasing his ticket to be wearing the should-be honoured uniform of
  Her Majesty the Queen.

Field-Marshal _Punch_ consequently feels it to be his duty to issue the
following orders:--

  1. In future, City Aldermen, in their official capacities, will
  refrain from making remarks calculated to bring the Army into
  ridicule, hatred, or contempt.

  2. If any regulation exists preventing soldiers in uniform from
  appearing in the better seats of places of entertainment, the rule in
  question must be immediately abolished.

  In conclusion, Field-Marshal _Punch_ is strongly of opinion that
  recruiting will continue to remain slack until the difference existing
  between the social conditions of the British Soldier in the present,
  and the Negro Slave in the past, is thoroughly understood and admitted
  by the public in general, and the people to whom this circular is
  addressed in particular. It must be remembered in future that the
  Livery of Her Majesty is worn by warriors, and not by flunkeys.

[Sidenote: _Mismanagement at Reviews_]

The remonstrance was well needed, though many years were to elapse
before the second of these orders was acted on. Yet if _Punch_ had
little mercy on those who imagined that _all_ soldiers were "brutal
and licentious," he had no compassion on those who disgraced their
uniform. In the controversy which arose in 1880 between Dr. W. H.
Russell and Sir Garnet Wolseley over alleged breaches of discipline
among our troops during the Zulu campaign, _Punch_ held that the
war correspondent's was a "true bill," and actually advocated the
reintroduction of flogging in the Army for "exceptional cases of
brutality which degrade the soldier to the level of the garrotter or
the wife-beater."

The allusions to the Volunteer Review in the Great Park at Windsor
in July, 1881, dwell chiefly on the habitual neglect and lack of
consideration meted out to the Army on these occasions:--

                         HOW TO TREAT THE ARMY

  Select the hottest day you can possibly find for a perfectly useless
  sham fight and send the men out with the heaviest, clumsiest, most
  antiquated, and unseasonable headgear. When a few of them perish, as
  a matter of course, of sunstroke, express the utmost astonishment
  that anybody can die from such a cause in such perfect uniform in a
  temperate climate.

                      HOW TO TREAT THE VOLUNTEERS

  Encourage fifty thousand men to attend a Review, and then tell them
  coolly that your military organization is quite unequal to the task
  of giving them a day's food.... As they are nearly all respectable
  middle-class members of Society, give them a shilling apiece to take
  care of themselves, and trust to their decency not to abuse such
  extraordinary liberality.

_Punch_ gave credit to the Duke of Cambridge for his efforts to improve
the amenities of barrack life, but came down heavily on him for
opposing the introduction, when the late Duke of Devonshire was at the
War Office, of neutral-tinted uniforms on active service. The Duke of
Cambridge thought it a good thing for a soldier that, when in action,
he should be visible, and _Punch_ dealt faithfully with this ducal
ineptitude:--

                          "THE THIN RED LINE"

                          (Horse Guards Duo.)

                                 Pro.

    Who says a soldier's a thing ready made
    Of a suit of grey and a service-spade?--
    That there's pluck in picking a 'vantage ground,
    Then digging a hole and heaping a mound?
    The notion's preposterous, laughable, quizzible!
    By Jove, Sir, a soldier--he ought to be visible!

                                 Con.

    I grant you all that; but when Six-foot Guards
    Like ninepins go down at a thousand yards,
    'Tis time to note that, if work's to be done,
    A field to be saved, a day to be won,
    It won't be by speeches as firework as fizzible,
    But by getting well home with movement invisible.

                                 Pro.

    Pooh! Stuff, Sir! What served us at Waterloo?
    Your neutral tint, or your washed-out blue?
    Digging and dodging?--I rather opine
    A rush with a cheer of a "thin red line,"
    In the midst of a hailstorm of all things whizzible!
    Don't talk, Sir, to me of a coat that's not visible!

                                 Con.

    No use, my good friend; for though you may bless
    The days that departed with Old Brown Bess,
    If you make that "red line," that never will yield,
    A target for every shot in the field,
    Of your foemen you'll stir the faculties risible--
    For neither your troops nor your brains will be visible!

[Sidenote: _Heroes, Charlatans and Criminals_]

Nor did _Punch_ in his zeal for the soldier on active service forget
the claims to grateful recognition of the ex-service man. In 1890 we
find an indignant appeal for the survivors of the Balaklava Charge,
showing how they had been forgotten--except in music-hall recitations.
To reinforce the appeal, _Punch_ printed a picture contrasting a
Balaklava survivor, dying in a garret, with the well-remunerated
professional "fasting man," one of whom was much in the public eye just
then. An even more lurid contrast in modern hero-worship is exhibited
in the sardonic description of the fêting and glorifying of criminals.
The verses "I'd be a criminal" show how fashion, pseudo-science,
sensational journalism, and sentimental folly conspired to apotheosize
the murderer.




                          THE STATUS OF WOMEN

[Sidenote: _Undomestic Daughters_]

The history of modern England as set forth in the files of _Punch_
is largely a record of the education of the average man; and there
are few, if any, aspects of this education during the period under
review in this volume in which greater changes are observable than
in _Punch's_ altered view of the _status_ of women. Even in his
earliest days he had "rounded Cape Turk"; he had never favoured an
Oriental seclusion of his womankind. But an element of condescension
and patronage mingled with his chivalry. Their efforts to emerge
from the sphere of domestic duties met for the most part with amused
ridicule. For the rest the phrase "pretty dears" fairly sums up
_Punch's_ earlier view of the place of women in the universe. This
view had already been largely modified. We have seen how he had been
shaken over the question of the suffrage, how he had been converted to
women's invasion of the medical and other professions, and to their
election to the London School Board. The progress of this recognition
continues throughout this period; the competition of women sometimes
excites chaff, sometimes misgiving, but it is no longer regarded as
futile. Their solid achievements in a variety of spheres of activity
are handsomely acknowledged. We hear less of the "pretty dears" and
"ducks"; they are increasingly credited with the capacity to hold their
own intellectually with the lords of creation. A conspicuous proof
of this altered view is to be found in the texts which accompany the
"social cuts" in the 'eighties and 'nineties. It has been said that
"the ball of repartee cannot be kept up without constant repercussion,"
but in the days of Leech the repercussive quality was denied to the
fair sex. This defect has _now_ been so completely redressed that the
balance inclines rather to the other side, and in Du Maurier's pictures
the "score" is generally given to the women. The day of the domestic
"doormat" was passing, and grown-up girls are no longer at the mercy
of pert or tyrannous schoolboy brothers. True, this self-assertion was
far from complete. The solidarity and cohesion of the family circle was
substantially unimpaired. Bachelor girls and revolting daughters were
a negligible minority; and in the 'eighties the number of professional
women was so small that unmarried aunts still played a considerable
part in the domestic system, and are frequently found in charge of
their small nephews and nieces. It was not until 1890 that _Punch_
included in his series of "Modern Types" that of "The Undomestic
Daughter"; and even then her self-expression is circumscribed by lack
of opportunity and, in the portrait given, can only find vent in
fussy and futile philanthropy. She is a dreary rebel, with a genius
for discomfort, who neglects her family when they need her most,
ultimately contracts an unromantic marriage, and ends up as a domestic
tyrant--a sort of variant on Mrs. Jellyby, but hardly recognizable as a
forerunner of the emancipated daughter of to-day.

ball_!"]

_Punch_ was already a convert to the higher education of women within
certain limits. His reservations are shown in 1875 in an interview
between Professor _Punch_ and an ideal candidate for the Ladies'
University as it should be. Domestic economy comes first in the
curriculum, the humanities second. A picture in the following year
would seem to indicate that _Punch's_ ideal was inverted, for one
Girton student is shown reading to another a valentine headed with
the famous lines from the _Antigone_ of Sophocles beginning [Greek:
Erôs anikate machan].[3] "How much jollier," she observes, "than
those silly English verses fellows used to send!" Classics were still
the predominant partner, and in 1878 _Punch_ notes and resents the
attempted revival of classical costume inaugurated by a fashionable
poetess. 'Arry's tirade against the higher education of women in 1879,
blaspheming against the whole movement as ridiculous and unnatural, is
heavily ironical, for in the same year _Punch_ has some friendly verses
on the extension of Girton and Newnham, and in 1880 congratulates
Miss Scott on being bracketed eighth Wrangler. _Punch_ simultaneously
congratulated Mrs., afterwards Lady Butler, on being elected an A.R.A.,
and rejoiced that the doors of the Academy had been reopened to the sex
once honoured in the days of Sir Joshua:--

  Mrs. Butler, née Elizabeth Thompson, _Punch_ takes off his hat to you
  as the first Lady Associate. Your predecessors, Angelica Kauffmann and
  Mary Moser, sprang into being full-blown R.A.'s.

  This is as it should be. At last _Punch_ may say, and with pride he
  says it, the Ladies are looking up--looking up to the high places of
  Science and Art, which should never have been held beyond their reach,
  and which will be graced by their occupancy.

  But when the Academy doors are reopened to the Ladies, let them be
  opened to their full width. Let us not hear of any petty restrictions
  or exclusions from this or that function or privilege of R.A. What
  these letters bring men let them bring to women.

_Punch's_ congratulations were premature. Forty years have elapsed, and
no women have yet been elected Associates.

[Footnote 3: The quotation reminds me that, when I was an undergraduate
at Oxford at this time, the handmaiden at a certain lodgings was called
"Annie Katie" by successive generations of undergraduates. These
were not her baptismal names: they had been bestowed upon her by an
ingenious scholar because her surname was Macan.]

[Sidenote: _A Song of Degrees_]

It was in 1880 again that _Punch_ backed the appeal of Girton for funds
to carry out the extension scheme and supported the petition of women
for university degrees. Here he represents the would-be woman graduate
as Vivien endeavouring to win over the recalcitrant academic Merlin:--

    In Arts, if once examiners be ours,
    To take degrees we must have equal powers;
      The loss of these is as the loss of all.

    It is the little rift within the lute,
    That soon will leave the Girton lecturer mute;
      And, slowly emptying, silence Newnham Hall.

    The little rift in academic lute,
    The speck of discontent in hard-earned fruit,
      That, eating inwards, turns it into gall.

    It is not worth the keeping; let it go:
    But shall it? Answer fairly, answer no;
      And take us all in all or not at all.

The decision of Durham University to grant women the B.A. degree in
1881 is cordially applauded, though the welcome is impaired by the
facetious heading, "'Ducks' at Durham"; and the liberality of Cambridge
in admitting women to the Tripos Examination is contrasted with the
churlishness of Oxford. As I write the tables have been turned and
Oxford is the paradise of the girl graduate.

In his earlier days _Punch_ never wearied of insisting on the
importance of cookery, but a set of verses in 1881 marks an altered
mood towards the old "woman in the kitchen" cry. Here the suggestion
is even made that _men_ would be benefited by a course of lessons in
cooking, and there is obvious irony in the concluding lines:--

    This is woman's true position--
      In the kitchen's inmost nook;
    And a lady's noblest mission
            Is to cook.

The two moods are subtly combined in Du Maurier's famous and
unforgettable picture of the cynical widow advising a wife of two
years' standing to "feed the brute."

[Illustration: EXPERIENTIA DOCET

WIFE OF TWO YEARS' STANDING: "Oh yes! I'm sure he's not so
fond of me as at first. He's away so much, neglects me dreadfully, and
he's so cross when he comes home. What _shall_ I do?"

WIDOW: "Feed the brute!"]

[Sidenote: _"Punch's" Misgivings_]

From the 'eighties onward physical culture plays an ever-increasing
part in the education of girls. _Punch_ went astray in assuming in 1883
that bicycling was impossible for women, but in this and the next year
we find him encouraging gymnastics for girls, though there is a touch
of satire in Du Maurier's fashionable mother, who boasts to an eligible
aspirant that every one of her daughters can knock their father down.
The invasion of the domain of pastime and athletics by women and girls
will be noted later on. For the moment I am concerned with their
intellectual rather than their physical development. Little is said of
girls' schools, though an interesting sidelight is shed on the methods
of the old-fashioned boarding-school in the picture of the charming
girl who explains to a Frenchman her fluency in his tongue: "At school
the girl who sat next me at dinner used to eat my fat, and I used to
do her French exercise for her; so I got lots of practice." Girls were
becoming more studious, more highly educated, but they were not all
female Admirable Crichtons. In 1885 _Punch_ chronicles the ingenuous
remark of a young lady to her friend, "Only fancy! _As You Like It_ is
by Shakespeare!" He welcomed the admission of lady graduates to the
Convocation of the University of London in 1884, but misgiving mingles
with admiration in his forecast of the omniscient "Woman of the Future"
in the same year:--

    The Woman of the Future! She'll be deeply read, that's certain,
    With all the education gained at Newnham or at Girton;
    She'll puzzle men in Algebra with horrible quadratics,
    Dynamics, and the mysteries of higher mathematics;
    Or, if she turns to classic tomes a literary roamer,
    She'll give you bits of Horace or sonorous lines from Homer.

    You take a maiden in to dine, and find, with consternation,
    She scorns the light frivolities of modern conversation;
    And not for her the latest bit of fashionable chatter,
    Her pretty head is wellnigh full of more important matter;
    You talk of Drama or Burlesque, theatric themes pursuing,
    She only thinks of what the Dons at Oxford may be doing.

           *       *       *       *       *

    The Woman of the Future may be very learned-looking,
    But dare we ask if she'll know aught of housekeeping or cooking?
    She'll read far more, and that is well, than empty-headed beauties,
    But has she studied with it all a woman's chiefest duties?
    We wot she'll ne'er acknowledge, till her heated brain grows cooler,
    That Woman, not the Irishman, should be the true home-ruler.

    O pedants of these later days, who go on undiscerning
    To overload a woman's brain and cram our girls with learning,
    You'll make a woman half a man, the souls of parents vexing,
    To find that all the gentle sex this process is unsexing.
    Leave one or two nice girls before the sex your system smothers,
    Or what on earth will poor men do for sweethearts, wives,
      and mothers?

Here we find _Punch_ reverting to his earlier attitude. Moreover,
as I have shown elsewhere, in the middle 'eighties he was in a
decidedly pessimistic frame of mind, and inclined, like Porson, to
"damn the scheme of things in general." The dismal mood passed, and
_Punch_ is himself again and obviously rejoicing in his own malice in
the verses on an imaginary episode at Girton, where a breakdown in
health, attributed to the excessive study of Browning, is traced to
over-indulgence in chocolate creams by the members of the Browning
Club. _Punch's_ claim to be regarded as an expert authority where
women's colleges are concerned is seriously invalidated by his
confusing the sites of Newnham and Girton and, worse still, by calling
the former "Nuneham" in the same year. But he redeemed himself
triumphantly in his study of "The Girton Girl" (No. IX, and by far
the best, of his series of "Studies from _Mr. Punch's_ Studio") in
December, 1886. I have the testimony of a distinguished Girton student
of nearly twenty years later that _Punch's_ sketch remained even then
a masterly dissection of the "mentality" of the Girton Girl, and
reveals an inside knowledge, both of generalities and details, which
no mere man could have attained. The Girton Girl of fact is carefully
distinguished from the Girton Girl of superstition. The latter is fast
becoming as extinct as the Dodo:--

[Sidenote: _The Girton Girl in 1886_]

  The modern schoolgirl is taking her place, no longer the giggling,
  flirting maiden of fiction, but an ascetic and hard-working young
  woman. Work has been her lot since the day when she stepped out of
  her cradle to combine education and amusement in the arrangement of
  alphabet bricks; and she looks back with a wistful incredulity to the
  time when the mystic letters, B.A., were to her nothing worse than
  the voice of the black sheep in the nursery rhyme. She inclines by
  instinct towards æstheticism in dress, affecting the limpest materials
  and the strangest hues, and making a compromise in the matter of
  collar and cuffs by wearing at neck and wrists a piece of very _écru_
  lace, turned down the wrong way. Her boots are the terror of stray
  blackbeetles, for a course of lectures on Hygienic clothing early
  taught her to view with horror and distrust a slim ankle and a pointed
  toe. She has a scholarly touch of shortsightedness, which she corrects
  by free use of the tortoiseshell _pince-nez_ that dangles from her
  neck.

  Her sense of duty is remarkable, and appalling. She virtuously accepts
  the onerous office of secretary to innumerable societies. Countless
  notices, in her bold and clear handwriting, may be seen day after
  day upon the College notice-boards, some of them of a sufficiently
  pathetic character. "Will the following members be so very good as to
  pay their subscriptions due the _term before last_ to the 'Society
  for promoting Masculine Intelligence'?" She does not even resent her
  appointment as sub-officer of the Fire Brigade, the duties of which
  position involve a constant personal supervision of two or three
  repulsively oily little hand-engines, which she tends and lubricates
  with loving care, till she has reduced her hands and face to the
  colour of the brown holland apron which enshrouds the rest of her
  person. Not even the horrors of an alarm practice can daunt her,
  though she may just have settled herself to revel for an hour in the
  pleasant byways of Professor Sidgwick's _Ethics_, when screams of
  "Fire!" rushing footsteps, and an alarm-rattle, such as heralds a
  bump in the May races, compel her to leave her books, and fly to the
  Hall. Then the canvas buckets must be produced, her corps arranged in
  alphabetical order, and marched off to the supposed scene of action.
  All this she does in an incredibly short time; and when, at the
  discretion of the head captain, the pumping of engines and passing of
  buckets is allowed to stop, she returns to her work with fortitude and
  resignation past belief.

[Illustration: HONOUR TO AGNETA FRANCES RAMSAY!

(Cambridge, June, 1887)]

Yet in spite of her multifarious and strenuous activities the Girton
Girl is not inhuman or immune to the appeal of her less serious-minded
fellow students, and the sketch ends with a really charming portrait
of a witty, incorrigibly frivolous, generously hospitable and
irresistibly popular member of the college. At once critical, judicial,
and genial, the study is a little masterpiece of its kind. The verses,
published some months earlier, on a young Spanish lady who took her
doctor's degree at Barcelona at the age of nineteen, are appropriately
cast in Swinburne's "Dolores" stanza (as that was her Christian name)
with the refrain, "Our M.D. of Spain," but are not remarkable either
as a parody or an appreciation. Much happier in every way is the
well-known picture of Miss Ramsay (afterwards Mrs. Montagu Butler)
entering a first-class carriage "For Ladies Only" on the occasion
of her being placed Senior Classic in 1887, an exploit which caused
_Punch_ once more to raise his voice on behalf of the bestowal of
degrees on women.

An even more remarkable success was achieved by Miss Philippa Fawcett,
who in 1890 was declared to be "above the Senior Wrangler," and
_Punch_, in "Topping the Tripos, or Something like a Score for the
Sex," while congratulating the daughter, did not forget her father,
always one of his heroes:--

    Above the Senior Wrangler! Pheugh!
      Where now are male reactionaries
    Who flout the feminine, and pooh-pooh
      Sweet Mathematic Megs and Maries?
    Who says a girl is only fit
      To be a dainty, dancing dangler?
    Here's girlhood's prompt reply to it:
      Miss Fawcett tops the Senior Wrangler!

    Would it not have rejoiced the heart
      Of her stout sire, the brave Professor?
    Agneta Ramsay made good start,
      But here's a shining she-successor!
    Many a male who failed to pass
      Will hear it with flushed face and jaw set,
    But _Mr. Punch_ brims high his glass,
      And drinks your health, Miss P. G. Fawcett!

[Sidenote: _The Eternal Feminine_]

Yet along with his acknowledgment of these scholastic triumphs, _Punch_
was equally ready to welcome evidences of feminine weakness in the
haunts of austere study. In 1888 Miss Helen Gladstone recalled the fact
that when she was at Newnham, a motion had been brought forward at the
Debating Society that "life without gossip was not worth living" and
carried by a large majority, and _Punch_ alluded to the incident under
the heading, "_Nous_ at Newnham."

To round off _Punch's_ educational record in this period, I may add
that in 1892 he alludes to that irrepressible controversialist, Sir
James Crichton-Browne, the champion of mutton chops, and common sense,
who had condemned the higher education of women from the medical point
of view. _Punch_ professes himself converted by a young Amazon who
reduces him to pulp and humiliation by her prowess at games of all
sorts.

[Illustration: THE OLD, OLD STORY

THE COLONEL: "Yes, _He_ was Senior Wrangler of his Year,
and _She_ took a Mathematical Scholarship at Girton; and now they're
Engaged!"

MRS. JONES: "Dear me, how interesting! And oh, how different
their Conversation must be from the insipid twaddle of Ordinary Lovers!"

THEIR CONVERSATION

HE: "And what would _Dovey_ do if Lovey were to _die_?"

SHE: "Oh, Dovey would die _too_!"]

The entrance of women into existing professions or the creation
by them of new callings is in the main viewed with sympathy and
benevolence. In the controversy that arose in 1875 between Mrs. Nassau
Senior, who had been appointed an inspector of Female Pauper Schools,
and Mr. Tufnell, an official of the L.G.B., _Punch_ espoused the side
of the lady, who, he considers, had the best of it both in temper and
argument. The statement in April of the same year that a lady had been
engaged by a firm of solicitors as consulting counsel at a high salary,
quoted from a Liverpool paper, was probably apocryphal; but it prompted
_Punch_ to observe that the more employments fit for gentlemen that are
opened to ladies the better. Any such calling is better than marriage
accepted merely as a situation.

[Sidenote: _"Jills in Office"_]

Unfortunately some doubt is thrown on the sincerity of this testimonial
by the sketch "Portia in Petticoats" in 1882--a burlesque description
of a solicitor's office where only women clerks are employed. After
a week's absence the head of the firm returns to find that they have
mostly disappeared, eloped or got married. The election of Miss Maude
Stanley, a cousin of the Dean, as a Guardian in 1877 is the subject of
a friendly notice at the expense of Bumble, who regards it as a "most
unporochial innowation." In the same year _Punch_ views with admiration
the beneficent work of the Ladies' Sanitary Association, established
twenty years earlier to inculcate the value of healthy, sensible habits
by means of lectures, tracts and handbooks. The suggestion made by a
Hastings doctor in 1879 that women might be employed as dispensers
is praised, though not without some reserves, in "Girls among the
Gallipots," and the new "Ladies' Association for the Promotion of
Horticulture and Minor Food Production" founded in the same year by
Mrs. Thorne meets with _Punch's_ unqualified approval. This is the
first mention that I have met in _Punch_ of a movement which led to the
establishment of the horticultural schools at Swanley and elsewhere
and the numerous poultry farms run by women all over the country. The
institution of the "Royal Red Cross" decoration for nurses in 1883 is
welcomed in friendly doggerel. As Bumble had condemned women guardians,
so Mrs. Gamp is now represented as very indignant and contemptuous of
the "nursing sisters," their position and recognition. But _Punch_
had no use here for amateurs. There is excellent point in Du Maurier's
picture of the applicant for the post of matron or head nurse to a
hospital who based her claim on being "not trained but gifted." By 1885
the female commercial traveller was apparently already in existence,
but _Punch_ treated this innovation with jocular suspicion:--

    I know a Maiden with a bag,
            Take care!
    She carries samples in a drag,
            Beware! beware!
            O Draper fond,
        She is fooling thee!

    She has the true "Commercial" style,
            Take care!
    To which she addeth woman's guile,
            Beware! beware!
            O Grocer goose,
        She is plucking thee!

And so on with other shopkeepers.

On the efficiency of female clerks _Punch_ speaks with two voices in
1887, under the heading "Jills in Office." First of all we have an
unflattering picture of the rudeness and inattention of the girls in
one of those joint establishments--half shop and half post-office. In
the next number we are given the reverse of the medal; the public are
the offenders, and the girls act up to their names--Miss Goodchild,
Miss Meekin and Miss Mannerly. The announcement in the same year
that ladies were to be allowed to take diplomas in dentistry prompts
_Punch_ to some frigid pleasantries; but this is a subject on which
it has always been difficult to joke with discretion. _Punch_ found a
happier theme in the institution of the "Lady Guide Association" in
1888. He applauds the scheme which aimed at "providing remuneration
and employment for intelligent gentlewomen debarred by the present
overcrowded labour market from earning a livelihood," but he recognized
that the guides would have to be very formidably accomplished persons,
since their duties comprised the giving advice and information to
newcomers on every possible subject. As a "preliminary examination" was
spoken of, _Punch_ supplied a test paper containing, _inter alia_, the
following questions:--

  1. A four-wheeled cab, containing five inside passengers, two children
  on the box, and seven trunks on the roof, is taken from Liverpool
  Street Station to the extreme end of Hammersmith, and the Lady who has
  secured your services as guide, after having made the cabman carry the
  seven trunks up to the third storey offers him, as his fare, two and
  ninepence, which he indignantly refuses. On his subsequently claiming
  thirteen and sixpence, and taking off his coat and offering to fight
  the gentleman of the party for that amount on the steps of the house
  in the presence of a sympathizing crowd, what speedy measures, if any,
  should you adopt to effect a compromise?

  2. You are engaged to conduct an intelligent, scientific, and
  inquiring party of sixteen people over Windsor Castle, the Marylebone
  Workhouse, the Thames Tunnel, Hanwell Lunatic Asylum, the National
  Gallery, the British Museum, and the London Docks. Do you think that
  your thorough knowledge of English history, your acquaintance with the
  working of the Poor Laws, your grasp of the progress of European Art,
  and your general familiarity with all the great political, commercial,
  engineering, economic and other problems of the hour are such as to
  warrant you in facing the coming ordeal with a jaunty confidence?

  3. You are required by an economical Duke to provide a cheap wedding
  for his only daughter, and he has stipulated that the breakfast
  shall not, at the outside, cost more than ninepence a head. With a
  four-and-sixpenny bridal cake, and a sound champagne that must not
  exceed fifteen shillings a dozen, how do you propose to make the thing
  go off with _éclat_?

In 1890 the "Dorothy" Restaurant was started for "Ladies Only," but
this condition, though the _raison d'être_ of the venture, was soon
modified: men were admitted from 6.30 to 10 P.M., and _Punch_ was
unchivalrous enough to make humorous capital out of the concession.

In regard to the suffrage and "Women's Rights" _Punch_ remained on
the side of the fence where he had got down after a good deal of
vacillation. In 1879 he publishes what is apparently a _bonâ fide_
letter from "A Lancashire Witch" protesting against Miss Lydia
Becker's claim to represent the general feeling of the district. "I
assure you," she writes, "that Miss Becker's followers are chiefly
ladies of her own pronounced politics, or semi-foreigners, and not
Englishwomen _pur sang_." _Punch_ observes that "no Lancashire
Witch need fear to be mixed up with the Representative Gathering of
vote-claiming Spinsters which Miss Lydia Becker threatens to bring
down on the Free Trade Hall. Witches who know whence comes the real
potency of their charms will certainly not seek to mix voting-powder
in the cauldron." This was not friendly to the Suffragists, but the
tone is preferable to that of 'Arry's views on Women's Rights in 1881
after attending a lecture. There is a certain admixture of shrewd
commonplace in his remarks, but the verses are chiefly remarkable as a
storehouse of cad-slang, fortunately mostly obsolete. Female emigration
comes up for comment in the same year, but, as the object was avowedly
matrimonial, the scheme had no political significance. The picture
of the large, self-indulgent, sultanic brother advising his adoring
sisters, cousins and aunts to assert their rights by learning to be
more independent of men is purely ironical and has no bearing on the
problem of women's economic dependence. The dialogue in two scenes
between Edwin and Angelina in 1883 on the working of the new Married
Women's Property Act is a rather cynical burlesque. The first scene
shows the Act as it is expected to work, to the advantage of women; in
the second we see it as it is sure to work--to the confirmation of the
_status quo_, the woman continuing to leave her money affairs entirely
in her husband's hands.

[Illustration: "THE ANGEL IN 'THE HOUSE'": OR, THE RESULT OF FEMALE
SUFFRAGE

(_A Troubled Dream of the Future_)]

[Sidenote: _Women Jurors_]

Sambourne's prophetic picture of "The Angel in 'the House'" in 1884
is an improvement on _Punch's_ earlier fancy portraits of women
legislators, but it does not render prophetic justice either to Lady
Astor or Mrs. Wintringham. _Punch_ refers more than once in 1885 to
the Parliamentary candidature of Miss Helen Taylor who stood for
Camberwell, but her nomination papers were not accepted. _Punch_ offers
"Helen of Camberwell" his condolences, but they are shorn of all grace
by his previous comparison of her to the Three Tailors of Tooley Street
and other acidulated puns. Du Maurier's picture in 1887 of a Jury of
Women antedates reality by more than thirty years; while the tension of
party feeling in 1888 is illustrated by the genuine advertisement of
a governess seeking work who had been "dismissed from a Conservative
Clergyman's family for her Gladstonian views." Lady canvassers were
already beginning to make their influence felt, and _Punch_ recognizes
their value in a "lay" which gives an entertaining account of their
"unscrupulous, seductive, siren ways." At any rate they could not be
ignored. The temper of "The Political Woman"--one of the "Modern Types"
series--in 1890 is acid and disparaging throughout:--

[Illustration: "A FAIR JURY, AND ALL HOME-RULERS"]

  Having left school with an ill-assorted mass of miscellaneous
  knowledge, she will show her contempt for ordinary feminine
  accomplishments by refusing to attend dances, and by crushing
  mild young men whom misfortune may have thrown in her way. Having
  discovered from one of these that he imagines the Rebecca Riots to
  be an incident of Old Testament History, and has no definite views
  upon the currency question, she will observe in a tone of some
  bitterness, that "These are our Governors!" and, having left him in a
  state of collapse, will scale the ramparts of political discussion,
  in company with a Professor, who happens to be unmarried and a
  Member of Parliament. After making love for some months, by means of
  an interchange of political tracts, these two will be married in a
  registrar's office and will spend their honeymoon in investigating the
  social requirements of Italian organ-grinders.

Thenceforward she exists chiefly as a member or president of
innumerable committees; she neglects her husband and the son "whom, in
a moment of regrettable absent-mindedness, she bore to the professor
and brings up on Spartan principles and little else." Her home is a
centre of slatternly discomfort:--

  She will eventually fail to be elected a member of the School Board,
  and having written a strong book on a delicate social question, will
  die of the shock of seeing it adversely reviewed in _The Spectator_.

Sir Albert Rollit's Bill for extending the franchise to women was
introduced in the early summer of 1892, and defeated on the second
reading by only twenty-three votes. _Punch_, in his "Essence of
Parliament," refers to an uproarious meeting in St. James's Hall,
and to Mr. Asquith's "merciless logic" in demolishing the Bill. The
Women's Liberal Federation had declared for the suffrage, and _Punch_
illustrated the situation in a picture of two political lady cricketers
appealing to the G.O.M. at the wicket: "A team of our own? I should
think so! If we're good enough to scout [i.e. field] for you, why
shouldn't we take a turn at the bat?"

Women's clubs increased in numbers throughout this period, but met
with little encouragement from _Punch_. In 1877 they are satirized
as enemies to domestic life; as the haunts of semi-detached, smart
women--types which _Punch_ portrayed in his "Dream of Queer Women"
(after Tennyson) in the same year, wherein mention is made of the
"shrieking sisterhood," realistic novelists, "art-beauties," shrewish
suffragists and shady adventuresses. When the project of a Women's
University Club was mooted in 1886, _Punch_ takes a less lurid view of
its possibilities. Smoking, card-playing and billiards are indicated,
but at worst the ladies will only be mild, if sedulous apes of the male
clubman. Gossip will predominate, and _Punch_ suggests that the new
venture should be called "The Blue-Stocking." As for smoking, in 1888
_Punch_ registered a protest under the title, "To a Fair Nicotian,"
in which the Laureate remonstrates with Lady Clara. He likes his own
yard-long Broseley clay pipe, but disapproves even of a cigarette in
the lips of lovely woman.

[Sidenote: _The Athletic Woman_]

[Illustration: AT "LORD'S"

(_It is always well to be well informed_)

CLARA (_pointing to the Umpires_): "Who are the two men in
billycock hats and white coats?"

MATILDA: "Oh, don't you know? Those are the headmasters of
Eton and Harrow!"]

Towards the athletic woman _Punch_ was, on the whole, more benevolent.
In 1883 he pays graceful homage to a woman with the engaging name of
Jessie Ace who had saved a man from drowning. In the same year young
ladies are gently chaffed for beginning to affect a knowledge of the
technicalities of pastime and sport. But if _Punch_ is to be believed,
it was still sketchy. Rugby and Association football are mixed up with
cricket, and the two charming girls at the Eton and Harrow match at
Lord's mistake the two umpires for the two headmasters. The slightly
more serious view taken in 1884, when several cricket matches were
played by women, is noted elsewhere. Fencing and boxing for women,
under male instructors, French and British, are depicted by Du Maurier
as "the last new fad" in 1886. The former, at any rate, came to stay
and deserved to. Ladies had long figured in lawn tennis tournaments,
but in his "Caution to Championesses" in 1887, _Punch_ displayed some
misgiving as to the development of this competition. Nor did he approve
of the novelty of women riding astride in 1890, begging them to do
anything but that, and rewriting the old nursery rhyme for these new
Amazons:--

    Ride a cock-horse,
    To Banbury Cross
    To see a young lady
    A-straddle o' course!

The _Almanack_ for the same year gives four types of model middle-class
wives. The French keeps her husband's accounts; the German is the
_Hausfrau_ and cook; the American is an intellectual; the English
plays lawn tennis. The "Manly Maiden" (No. XXII in _Punch's_ "Modern
Types") described in December, 1890, is less closely observed and
far less interesting than _Punch's_ "Model Fast Lady" of forty years
earlier. The sketch is a rather cruel caricature of the persevering
but inefficient sportswoman who is always in the way, and is destined
to "develop from a would-be hard-riding maiden into a genuinely
hard-featured old maid." In agreeable contrast to this acid study
is _Punch's_ homage to the exploits of a Guernsey rifle-woman, Miss
Leale, at Bisley in 1891, and his welcome to Mrs. Sheldon, the American
traveller, on her return from her travels in Africa, in which he
suggests that in time to come Stanley may be known as "the male Mrs.
Sheldon." The exaggeration may be ironical, but the irony is so well
veiled as to be almost imperceptible. In the years that were to come
the achievements of Mary Kingsley and Gertrude Bell were beyond the
reach of the most subtle disparagement.

[Sidenote: _Women Workers_]

[Illustration: A NEW TASTE IN MEN AND WOMEN

SHE: "What a fine-looking man Mr. O'Brien is!"

HE: "H'm--hah--rather rough-hewn, I think. Can't say I admire
that loud-laughing, strong-voiced, robust kind of man. Now that's a
fine-looking woman he's talking to!"

SHE: "Well--er--somewhat _effeminate_, you know. Confess I
don't admire _effeminate_ women!"]

On the subject of women workers _Punch's_ utterances are apparently
but not really irreconcilable. The "Wail of the Male; being a British
workman's view of the cheap female labour question, respectfully
submitted to the Trade Union Congress" in 1887, is a protest against
women undercutting men in the labour market. But the voice is the
voice of 'Arry, not of _Punch_--shrewd, glib and entirely selfish.
The speaker has just got the "bullet"--having been sacked without
notice--and speculates on further possibilities:--

                Look here, Bill! If they shunt
    You and me, and our like, as they're doing all round,
    Because Women are cheap, and there's heaps to be found,
    Won't it come to this, sooner or later, my boy,
    That the most of us chaps will be out of employ,
    Whilst the Women will do all the work there's to do,
    And keep us, and the kids, on about half our "screw"?
    Who's a-going to gain by that there but the boss?
    And for everyone else it is bound to be loss.
    A nice pooty look-out! Oh, I know what they say--
    That the women work better than us for less pay,
    And are much less the slaves of the pint and the pot,
    What's that got to do with it? All tommy rot!
    We have all got to live, and if women-folk choose
    To collar our cribs or to cut down our screws,
    _They_ will have to be bread-winners, leaving us chaps
    To darn stockings at home with the kids on our laps.
    Well, I hope as they'll like it. I tell you what, neighbour,
    The world's being ruined by petticoat labour.
    Besides, Mate, in spite of this Woman's Rights fuss,
    Work don't make 'em better _as_ women, but wuss.
    It mucks 'em for marriage, and spiles 'em for home,
    'Cos their notion of life is to racket and roam.
    Just look at that work-girl there, her with the fringe!
    She's a nice pooty specimen! Makes a chap cringe
    To think of that flashy young chit as a wife.
    That's what cheap woman labour will do for our life.
    Oh, give 'em the Vote, and the breeks, while you're at it,
    Make 'em soldiers, and Bobbies, and bosses. But, drat it,
    If this blessed new-fangled game's to prewail,
    I pities the beggar who's born a poor Male!

Against these arguments, illustrative of a certain habit of mind, which
at best excite a grudging acknowledgment of their coarse common sense,
one may set the "Dream of Unfairly Treated Women" (after Tennyson) in
1890, describing the hardships of sempstresses, governesses, "slaveys"
and shop-girls, the victims of sweating, greed, and worse, which
unhappily were all too prevalent so recently as thirty years ago.

_Punch_, in fine, exhibits through this period a progressive
acknowledgment of women's claims to be regarded as an intelligent
being, tempered by moments of reaction. In 1875 he has a picture of an
evening party at which all the men are anxious to be introduced to the
wonderful Miss Pynke, that _rara avis_ "who has never written a novel
or contributed to a magazine." In 1887 the "score" is given to the
professor in his retort to the "high-brow" lady:--

  MISS HYPATIA: "Yes, now that we are gradually educating
  ourselves up to your level, you Men ought at least to meet us
    halfway."

  THE PROFESSOR: "Meet you halfway? How? By gradually
  _un_educating ourselves down to yours?"

[Sidenote: _Feline Amenities_]

In 1890, again, the amusing series of "Feline amenities" continued
for some years, though they are a tribute to the wit of women, are
invariably based on a denial of the quality of magnanimity. In this
context I am minded to include a curiosity, dating from the year
1886, in the shape of an imaginary letter signed "Elizabeth Fry
Romper," which is of interest as showing the change in the attitude of
philanthropic women during the century. The writer describes how "of
course on the hottest day of the whole summer" she was told off to take
a lot of Sunday school girls for "a day in the country" to Greenwich,
"which is supposed to have an elevating effect upon them for the rest
of the year." Of all the disagreeable things she ever has to do, this
is "far the worst." The picture given is decidedly realistic:--

  It is no joke waiting for an hour at a suburban station, with eighty
  "young girls"--_real_ young girls--pouring in by detachments, all in
  the wildest state of excitement, and decked with the entire contents
  of their jewel-cases. Of course, the first thing they did was to
  rush, helter-skelter, into a wrong train, and all the railway staff
  hardly sufficed to pull them out again before the train started. I
  had a whole compartment to look after, and felt rather nervous at
  the thought that the next one was filled with men--smoking shocking
  tobacco, by the way--and that the _talk_ was distinctly _audible_.

  I was truly thankful to reach Greenwich, and trusted that the girls
  might be fully occupied in getting tea, and that the heavy cake might
  calm down their excitement a little. So we all set to with a great
  deal of unnecessary bustle, and were flattering our elderly hearts
  that everything was going off splendidly, when, on the bell being
  rung--we had brought one on purpose--for the girls to be seated, the
  Superintendent looked round for the head girl to lead the singing
  grace. Instead of pious music of any sort, our ears were greeted with
  a shout of discordant laughter, which was found to proceed from some
  broken ground in the distance, where the _whole_ of our first class
  were engaged in playing _Kiss in the Ring_ with a party of soldiers
  from the neighbouring barracks. My dear, if you could have seen
  the picture, you would never have forgotten it. I thought I should
  have died of laughing on the spot. The hot, dishevelled, romping
  girls, and the smart soldiers, quite unconscious of the awful face
  of the Superintendent, as she advanced towards them, and the way the
  damsels scuttered off as she let fall a few words of rebuke--it was
  the funniest thing I ever saw. She succeeded in driving her flock,
  sheepish but giggling, before her; all but one, who stoutly declined
  to leave her soldier, declaring she didn't want no tea, but would 'ave
  a spree in the merry-go-round with 'im. A separation was ultimately
  effected, but the gloom that hung over that meal I never shall forget.
  It was a mercy everyone else took it so seriously, or I couldn't have
  held out; as it was, when I got home, I laughed myself nearly into a
  fit.

The combination of duty, detachment and a sense of humour is not
commonly credited to Victorian girls. But the problems that had to be
tackled were very much the same, and so was human nature.




                               EDUCATION

Hasty generalizations from the study of _Punch_ throughout this period
might easily lead one to the conclusion that the two great evils
in national education were the craze for athletics in Public and
Preparatory, and over-pressure in Board and Elementary, Schools. A
more detailed examination of his pages tends to correct or modify this
view. _Punch_ was in the main a firm believer in the public school
system as an instrument of character-building, and he was no enemy
of the ladder of learning which had been erected by Forster's Act of
1871. But while he detested snobbery, extravagance and complacent
Philistinism, he was by no means satisfied that the State was getting
good value for its constantly increasing expenditure on education. Thus
to take the Elementary schools first, we find continual references,
mostly unfavourable, to the administration and working of the Board
School System. In 1875 he falls foul of the pedantry of over-zealous
officials--the red-tape methods of inspectors, and the action of
visitors who sent children back to school before they were free
from infection. These inquisitorial activities roused _Punch's_ old
democratic sympathies, and some ten years later we find him suggesting
that a similar method might fairly be applied to the upper and upper
middle classes--that what was sauce for the goose in the slums might be
served up to the gander in the squares.

nights. But reelly I calls it a flyin' in the face o' Providence to be

In the series of articles on "Education Made Easy" in 1887, _Punch_
sympathizes with the mothers who were constantly harried by "attendance
officers" for neglecting to send their children to the Board Schools.
Ignorance was a great evil, but the Board Schools were attempting too
much. The essentials were not thoroughly taught; pupil-teachers were
overworked; there was too much of the 'ologies, and the three R's
were in danger of going to the wall. The reactionary protest against
the teaching of music--"We don't want Grisis at Board Schools"--is
ironical; but _Punch_ espoused the cause of those who condemned
over-cramming in Board Schools, and based their crusade on Sir James
Crichton-Browne's Report on over-pressure in 1884. But his great point
was that there was too much teaching of the things that did not matter.
His "Indignant Ratepayer" in 1887 welcomes the decision of the London
School Board to hold an inquiry into the curriculum of their schools.
The special committee were also to report "whether such changes can
be made as shall secure that children leaving school shall be more
fitted than they now are to perform the duties and work of life before
them." One of the speakers had declared that "the boys educated in
public elementary schools scorned all handicraft work, and wanted to be
clerks, while girls in like-manner scorned all domestic service." The
"Indignant Ratepayer" congratulated the School Board on turning over a
new leaf, though it had taken them sixteen years to realize that they
were on the wrong tack.

[Sidenote: _Indignant Ratepayers_]

A week later _Punch_ published another letter from another "Indignant
Ratepayer," deprecating the congratulations as premature and
indiscreet:--

  I, too, _Mr. Punch_, am a ratepayer; I have seen my rates trebled
  since the creation of the School Board; and I am now told that I ought
  to thank my stars that, after sixteen years' work, they have at length
  displayed a glimmering of common sense. There seems to be something
  ominous in this term of sixteen years, for it appears that it is just
  for this period that we have been supplying the Army with bayonets
  that won't stab, and the Navy with cutlasses that won't cut. We are
  always calling ourselves, though nobody else does, a practical people.
  But what care we for the opinion of our neighbours, so long as we are
  happy in the calm contemplation of our superiority?

  "The unexpected always happens," so said Beaconsfield, and it seems
  he was right, for who would have ever dreamed that the School Board
  would have ever made such a confession? But although they confessed
  much, they did not confess all. They said nothing of the numberless
  half-starved children whose health has been impaired or ruined by the
  tasks imposed upon them. Nothing of the hundreds of thousands spent in
  bullying and worrying their poor parents. Nothing of the money spent
  in endless litigation. On all such subjects the Board are discreetly
  silent. They draw attention only to the outcome of their labours,
  namely the boys and girls whose education has been completed--the
  survival of the fittest in short--but who are fit for nothing.

  "No handicraft work for the boys, no domestic service for the girls."
  The boys all want to be clerks; what the girls want to be we are not
  informed, but domestic service is not to be thought of, so the sooner
  my wife and daughters take to such work the better. And for this
  have I paid trebled rates. For this have we been passing Code after
  Code, and fixing Standard after Standard, to find at last that the
  whole work must be begun afresh. I too am indignant, as well as your
  Correspondent, not that the School Board have been telling the truth,
  but that they have been so long in telling it.

  I protest against my money having been spent in injuring the health of
  half the poor children of London, and of injuring the morals of the
  other half.

_Punch_ was ready to give a hearing to economists who really felt the
burden, but he had no sympathy with the "old gang" of City Fathers
who were frankly obscurantist on the subject of education, while they
were proud of having dined and wined themselves into the possession of
"first class stomachs":--

 "WHERE IGNORANCE IS BLISS," ETC.

  That not particularly learned body which rejoices in the name of the
  Commissioners of Sewers of the City of London, held a Special Meeting
  at the Guildhall last week, to discuss the terribly extravagant
  conduct of the London School Board in adding one penny in the pound to
  the amount of the rate to be levied in the wealthy City of London for
  the ensuing year. Much burning eloquence, of the peculiar City type,
  was used on the occasion, and a statement by one highly excited member
  that there were no fewer than 313 Board Schools in the Metropolis in
  which the great work of education was being successfully carried on,
  and that the cry was still for more, was received with as terrible a
  groan of horror as if it had been announced, on authority, that there
  were to be no more "Cakes and Ale" for the Sewage Commissioners.

  In vain was it stated by those who, apparently, love light rather than
  darkness, that whereas the population of London some ten or twenty
  years ago was one of the most ignorant of any capital of Europe, it
  was now, thanks to the School Board, assuming its proper place in this
  respect, by giving all its children a good education. They were met by
  a shout of derision from an angry Commissioner, who demanded to know
  "why they didn't try to teach a cow to win the Derby," which brilliant
  interrogation elicited great applause.

  In vain was it suggested that this sudden affectation of sympathy
  with the poor Ratepayer for having to pay this additional penny for
  education, was but a blind to screen their own increased rate of
  double the amount, for a purpose of not one-tenth the importance.
  The Sewage Commissioners listened with impatience, reserving their
  enthusiastic approbation for the very demonstrative gentleman who
  addressed them after their own heart; and in language that all could
  understand and thoroughly sympathise with. He was quite willing,
  generous soul, that the poor children should have bread, but what he
  objected to was rumpsteaks! and he concluded his brilliant oration
  with the following magnificent peroration:--"Everybody should have
  his meal, but he must have a stomach of the highest class before they
  could give him turtle soup and port wine!"

  Who but a member of the City Corporation could have contrived, when
  discussing the question of the education of the Poor, to have brought
  in those two gods of his idolatry, turtle soup and port wine? And in
  combination too!

[Illustration: PROGRESS

YOUNG RUSTIC: "Gran'fa'r, who was Shylock?"

SENIOR (_after a pause_): "Lauk a' mussy, boy, yeou goo to
Sunday Skewl, and don't know that!"]

This well-merited castigation preceded the protests of the "Indignant
Ratepayers" by a couple of years, but it is more truly representative
of _Punch's_ convictions on the main question. We had to educate our
masters, and we must not squeal over the bill--provided the education
was sound. On that point _Punch_ was by no means satisfied, and in 1887
he invokes the testimony of the British workmen, who is made to protest
against the unpractical nature of modern education, and the undue
prominence assigned to the 'ologies and 'ometries. A cartoon in 1888
represents Education betrayed by its "friends"--pedantry and jobbery.
Over-pressure was aggravated by under-feeding and under-housing.
As for the former, _Punch_ prints an East End remonstrance against
the penny rate: "When we wants daily bread it ain't any good saying
you only wants 'that there penny.'" But the steady growth of State
expenditure on education is resented on the ground that it was
devoted to inappropriate or unnecessary objects. In 1891 _Punch_
publishes a forecast of the Exasperated Public protesting against
the ever-increasing extravagance of the London School Board, who have
taken to building observatories and raised the salaries of elementary
teachers to £2,500 a year.

This is burlesque, but there is criticism and dissatisfaction at the
back of it. So when the Bill providing for "assisted" (i.e. Free)
Education, for which the Budget surplus of £2,000,000 was to be
devoted, was introduced in the same year, _Punch_ represented the
cross-currents of the Unionist Party in his cartoon. Mother Goschen,
the Chancellor of the Exchequer, is seen introducing her adopted
child (Free Education), whom she had found in Birmingham, to the Old
Tory Party (Mrs. Gamp), who doesn't like the looks of him at all.
But Goschen carried his point--that the Government were pledged to
alleviate the burden which compulsory education had, in recent years,
imposed upon the poorer portion of the people; and by September 1 the
free education proposals of the Government were generally adopted
throughout the country by both Board and Voluntary Schools.

The old question of corporal punishment comes up in 1880 and 1881, but
in a new light. There was "one law for the rich and another for the
poor," but here, at any rate, it could not be maintained that the poor
were oppressed. Already flogging was only commonly resorted to in the
schools for the upper classes, and _Punch_ emphasizes the contrast in
his dialogue between the Peer and the Peasant. The Peasant observes
that when he is tapped over the head with a cane, his mother goes and
bashes the teacher over the head with the poker and gets him fired
for assaulting her son. The Peer, on the other hand, owns to having
been "swished" four times in a fortnight without attempting reprisals.
Whereupon the Peasant suggests that he should have sent _his_ mother
to go and bang his old master. If _Punch_ is to be believed, conflicts
between teachers and parents were pretty frequent at this time. They
are not unknown even to-day; but parents are less inclined to take the
law into their own hands.

[Sidenote: _Literature and Crime_]

The education of the million, however, was not confined to school
hours, and with the decline of illiteracy the growth of the reading
habit brought its perils as well as its privileges. Juvenile
criminality was no longer the result of ignorance and neglect--at least
to the same extent. _Punch_ was inclined to trace the evil largely to
the low tone of the cheap literature provided for the young. In the
Diary of a Boy Burglar in 1886, his downfall is ascribed to his putting
into practice the principles imbibed by a perusal of _Jack Sheppard_.
A somewhat alarmist article in the _Fortnightly Review_ on "What Boys
Read" declared that while many boys' books were healthy and helpful,
the majority of the journals supplied for the children of the working
classes were devoid of every element of sweetness and light. "They are
filled with stories of blood and revenge, of passion and cruelty, as
improbable and almost impossible in plot as they are contemptible in
literary execution."

The solution of the matter by Press censorship, advocated by the
writer, presented difficulties which _Punch_ did not shirk, and his own
views, though strong, are tempered by sound common sense:--

  Ainsworth's story may serve the turn of an Opéra-bouffe Librettist,
  and the scamp himself be played by a sprightly actress without much
  harm being done to anybody. _Jack Sheppard_, for instance, ought not
  to be sanctioned by the Licenser any more than _Claude Duval_, _Dick
  Turpin_, or any other drama of a like kind, of which the recognized
  motive is the veiled incentive to crime. Still, a raid on Harrison
  Ainsworth, notwithstanding the acknowledged mischief that has been
  done to the young and ignorant by a perusal of his cracksman's
  romance, would scarcely be the same thing, and yet the cases are
  sufficiently parallel to admit at least of argument. We should be
  inclined to suppress such romances as _Jack Sheppard_, _Rookwood_,
  Bulwer's _Claude Duval_, and also _Eugene Aram_, which was so severely
  and so justly satirized by Thackeray in _Mr. Punch's_ pages. For the
  truth about Jack Sheppard our readers have only to refer to one of the
  earliest volumes of _Mr. Punch's_ series, where they will find his
  character as described by Ainsworth, and his true character as given
  in the Newgate Calendar, displayed side by side in parallel columns.
  _There was no sort of romance about the real Jack Sheppard._

  Meantime, for want of a better remedy to meet the evil, let parents
  and guardians, and those who have charge and direction of the
  young idea, keep their eyes open and have a special regard to the
  direction in which it shows inclination to shoot. It is just as
  ready to derive its nutriment from the "penny healthful," as from
  the "penny dreadful," and as a mere matter of commercial enterprise,
  the former could be as easily forthcoming and available as the
  latter. Philanthropy is continually actively busying itself about
  the education of the young--here is something practical for it to
  do--let it look to the quality of its _Magazine literature_. It wants
  some energy and some capital, but both in these days ought to be
  forthcoming. To drive the penny dreadful out of the literary field is
  not a task beyond the powers of organization and enterprise. And it is
  in this direction that the first steps will be taken in the material
  and moral amelioration of "What boys read."

The subject recurs in 1889 and 1890, when sensational juvenile
literature is again denounced; but the new stories are more
vigorously condemned than the old, and the Ghost of Jack Sheppard,
in a conversation with the Shade of Dick Turpin, scouts the notion
that _they_ could upset the minds of the young. Why, they weren't in
it with the papers read by everyone everywhere! _Punch_ vigorously
supported the efforts of those who sought to abate the evils of child
insurance, and welcomed the intervention of Magee, then Archbishop of
York, who died while on a visit to London to attend a Committee of
the House of Lords on his Infant Insurance Bill, in May, 1891. But
when the Prevention of Cruelty Bill was in Committee in the summer of
1887, _Punch_ strongly supported the Attorney-General's amendment to
omit from the Bill the words prohibiting the employment of children
under ten in theatres and licensed places of public entertainment. Mr.
Mundella, who was in charge of the Bill, accepted the amendment, but
"Dick Temple, Sam Smith and other superlatively good people objected,"
and it was defeated both in the Committee and the Report stages, to
_Punch's_ undisguised annoyance. After the Bill became law in July,
he added "one word more," and his arguments, if not convincing, are
at least consistent with his life-long sympathy with the professional
actor:--

[Sidenote: _The Stage and Education_]

  Well-intentioned persons do a heap of mischief, and talk and write a
  lot of nonsense about what they don't understand. There are dangers to
  morality ("who deniges of it?") in the Theatrical Profession, as in
  every other profession; but these affect the amateur, and those who
  go on the stage late in life, not those who are to the manner born.
  The loves of poor, honest, hard-working theatrical families, where the
  sons and daughters obtain theatrical employment at an early age, are
  thoroughly respectable. Their stage-work is not only compatible with
  their receiving a sound education, but is a complement of it. Habits
  of strict discipline, cleanliness, and domestic thrift are inculcated;
  the little children, from the biggest down to "the Widow's Mites"
  engaged in a Pantomime, are seldom sick, and never sorry, but do their
  work with pleasure, and would probably be willing to undertake even
  "more study," rather than be deprived of their theatrical employment
  which brings in the money, pays the school, and helps to keep a happy
  family together under one roof, which, "be it never so 'umble," is
  styled by that dear old English word "home"--and there is no place
  like it. The efforts of those who would exclude children under ten
  from theatrical work may cause great misery and break up many such
  happy homes. We say this in serious earnest, and, from practical
  experience, we do know what we are talking about.

_Punch_ resented pedantic, official, or fussy interference with
children whether at work or play. A Children's Party at the Mansion
House in January, 1881, provokes well-merited ridicule. No mixed
dancing was allowed; the only diversion was provided by some "hideous
negro entertainers" and, by way of compensation, a sermon by Mr.
Spurgeon! After 11.30 P.M. young ladies were allowed to dance,
but _only_ with young ladies; and the young gentlemen with young
gentlemen. At the same time _Punch_ was a believer in the cane, when
administered with discretion, and a resolute discourager of precocity.
The full-page illustration in the _Almanack_ of 1884, "Education's
Frankenstein," representing the omniscient child of the future, ruining
all professions, as everyone can do everything, is an extravagant
burlesque, but it foreshadows the complaints we have had of late of
the "unfair competition" of the infant author and artist with the
adult practitioner. In 1885 Du Maurier's Child of the Period gravely
rebukes her grandmother who speaks of a "puff-puff"--"The locomotive, I
suppose you mean, grandmamma." But this is a form of joke which recurs
throughout the ages.

_Punch's_ "Winter Exhibition of the Works of Young Masters" in 1888 is
a really illuminating piece of prophetic satire. The exhibitors are all
children, and the works shown all belong to the Nursery Period. We may
take one example:--

  Billy Bolaine, born 1868, flourished 1880-2. No. 3. _Landscape, with
  horse, ducks and figures._ Silvery effect of about eight o'clock in
  the morning anywhere. The animals have given rise to some discussion,
  but the general impression seems to be that the artist, who never
  depicted anything without a subtle meaning, originally intended at
  least one of them for a cow.

Altogether this is an excellent skit on the critics who greet all the
efforts of the young with a foolish voice of praise. Self-conscious,
aggressive and complacent precocity _Punch_ could not endure; the small
American child who treats a bishop, who had endeavoured to repress
him, as a back number, is clearly regarded as a nuisance. But in his
plea for the unhappy infant prodigy _Punch_ recognized it as a real
grievance that child performers were overworked by over-practising and
continual travelling. In 1888 it was borne in upon him that, whether
from the engrossing nature of modern girls' and boys' occupations, or
their preference for contemporary and realistic fiction, the study of
Fairy Tales and Nursery Lore was fast falling into neglect if not into
positive contempt. To avert what he considered a national calamity, he
felt it his duty to suggest to parents that no child should be allowed
on any pretext in future to leave the Nursery for School until it had
passed an examination in these subjects.

[Sidenote: _Fairy Tale Test Papers_]

_Punch's_ test papers are all excellent, but I can only find room for
the General and the Pantomime Papers:--

                        CRITICAL AND GENERAL.

  1. What is your opinion of the intelligence of Giants as a race? Of
  what substance were they in the habit of making their bread? Would you
  draw any and what distinction between (a) Giants and Giantesses, (b)
  Ogres and Ogresses, (c) a Mamma Ogress and her daughters?

  2. What is a Roc? What do Rocs feed on? If you were on the edge of
  steep cliffs surrounding an inaccessible valley, strewn with diamonds
  and visited by Rocs--how would you proceed in order to obtain some of
  those diamonds? Give the reply of the Slave of the Lamp to Aladdin's
  request that a Roc's egg should be hung up in his dome.

  3. Mention instances when (a) a Wolf, (b) a Bear, (c) a Cat, (d) a
  Harp, are recorded to have spoken, and give the substance of their
  remarks, when possible, in each case.

  4. Write down the name of any hero you can remember who suffered
  inconvenience from (a) the imprudence, (b) the disobedience, of his
  wife.

  5. How would you act if you were invited to go to a party on the
  opposite side of the way, and had nothing to go in but a pair of
  Seven-Leagued Boots? Compare the drawbacks and advantages of going to
  a State Ball in glass slippers.

  6. State which family you would rather belong to: One in which
  there was (i.) a Wicked Uncle, (ii.) an Envious Sister, (iii.) a
  Jealous Brother, or (iv.) a Cruel Stepmother? Give your reasons, and
  illustrate them by examples. How many Wicked Uncles do you remember to
  have read of? Are Wicked Uncles ever sorry, and, if so, when?

  7. Give any instances that occur to you where it is stated that the
  chief personages of the story "all lived happily ever afterwards." Are
  there any exceptions to this rule?

                           PANTOMIME PAPER.

  (Optional, and for those Students only who may decide to "take up"
  this branch of the subject.)

  1. Did the manners, language, and general deportment of the various
  Kings and Queens you have seen in Pantomimes correspond at all with
  what you had expected them to be from the books?

  2. Mention any fairy tale in which (1) long ballets, (2) allusions
  to subjects in last year's papers, (3) jokes about "drinks" and
  "pawn-tickets," (4) comic duets which you didn't quite understand, and
  (5) men dressed up in women's clothes, occur. Mention (if you can) any
  Pantomime in which they do not.

  3. Were you surprised to hear at Drury Lane that the King who
  befriended the Marquis of Carabas was originally a Potman? Do you
  remember this in the original text?

  4. Why do you suppose that the Wicked Brothers in this year's
  Pantomime were frightened by green snakes, pink lizards, and enormous
  frogs? Did their own explanation that they had "the jumps" convey much
  to your mind? Did this scene make you laugh?

  5. Give as clear and intelligible an account as you are able of the
  story of any one Pantomime you have been to, mentioning where--if at
  all--it departed from the version you have studied, and whether or
  not you considered such departures (if any) to be improvements.

  6. Investigate the principal peculiarities of Pantomime Animals. How
  do they chiefly differ from other animals? Describe the effect of
  kindness upon a Pantomime Donkey, and account for it.

  N.B.--Not more than four questions need be attempted in each of
  the above papers. Candidates are advised not to leave any question
  unattempted from a mere inability to answer every part of such
  question.

The Pantomime Paper conveys some excellent dramatic criticism, which is
needed as much to-day as thirty years ago, but it may be permitted to
stand in this educational context. As a counterblast to the charge of
indifference towards fairy tales on the part of the modern child, it is
only right to add that in 1892 Du Maurier's picture, "A Warning," shows
a touching belief in the actuality of Bluebeard:--

  ARCHIE (to his Sister, who has been reading him Fairy Tales):
  "Won't there be a lot of Us, if none of us go and get married? Worse
  than Hop-o'-my-Thumb!"

  SISTER: "Yes; but you know I mean to be married!"

  ARCHIE: "Do you mean to say you'd go and live alone with a
  Man after reading Bluebeard?"

When we turn to the Public and Preparatory Schools we find that
_Punch's_ criticisms resolve themselves into a triple indictment of
their costliness, their curriculum and their undue exaltation of
athletics. The attack on the athletic craze begins in 1875, when
_Punch_ published an imaginary Report of a boy's work for 1895 at St.
Paul's, Eastminster, which deals with nothing but his progress at games
and sports.

[Sidenote: _The Fetish of Games_]

The charge had a good deal to justify it, but the choice of a name was
not happy, since Colet's famous foundation has in its recent phase
never invited criticism on the score of any slackness in studious
industry. _Punch_ renews the attack more than once. In 1880, in a
burlesque account of a Prize Day, brain-work is just tolerated;
athletic prowess is the only thing really encouraged and rewarded. Yet
simultaneously we encounter Master Freddy from Eton, who considers that
energy of any sort is "bad form." "Good form," in _Punch's_ view,
might easily degenerate into a snobbish fetish, and in one of his
"International Comparisons," in the _Almanack_ of 1879, he emphasizes
the comprehensiveness of French public schools as contrasted with the
class distinctions observed in England. It was in the same year that an
inquiry was held into the administration of Wellington College and the
alleged departure from the intentions of the founders. _Punch_ took the
line that what was meant to be a military orphanage had become a rather
costly public school of the common type, and noted that Mr. Gladstone
defended the change because Benson, his son-in-law, was head master.
This was a partial error. Gladstone's son-in-law was Wickham, who had
succeeded Benson as head master. But the sting remained. _Punch_, it
may be added, was thoroughly consistent in his attitude of antagonism
to the diversion of old foundations from their original aims.

[Illustration: THE NEW TYRANNY

"Of course you needn't _Work_, Fitzmilksoppe; but _Play_ you _must_ and
_shall_."]

The costly inefficiency of the public schools came up again in 1880, _à
propos_ of a correspondence in _The Times_, in which a "disappointed
mother" recounted the experience of her two sons who, on leaving a
public school at the age of nineteen, had forgotten all they knew
before they went there:--

  Hence a justly "Disappointed Mother" naturally enough concludes that
  "_Our great schools want inspection sadly_." Experience has certainly
  given her some cause to compare them unfavourably with private
  schools; although as to the latter she generalizes rather widely in
  saying that they "must teach, or close." Too many of them do neither.

  Her boys, at any rate, both of them learned at a Private Boarding
  School enough to enable them to pass the Junior Oxford Local
  Examination at an early age. Unquestionably they were taught so much;
  but then how were they taught it? In such a style that they have now,
  at an adult age, to be taught it over again.

  So it seems that a "Disappointed Mother's" two sons were educated
  at the Private Boarding School as the bottles are aërated in a
  soda-water manufactory. Information must have been forced into the
  former as carbonic acid gas is pumped into the latter. The gas is
  retained in the bottles whilst corked down, but escapes on the
  removal of pressure; so, if the boyish minds are left open, their
  school-learning, set free from forcible compression, goes off in
  youthful effervescence. Admirable system, by which our youth at an
  early age are enabled to pass the examinations, for which at maturer
  years they have to be crammed all over again!

[Sidenote: _Classics v. Commerce_]

The inspection of public schools has remained a subject of acute
controversy ever since; and it is not clear whether _Punch's_ approval
would have extended to Government inspection. It was in the same year,
by the way, that Du Maurier illustrated the dialogue between Sir
Gorgius Midas and an aristocratic Colonel. Sir Gorgius's main regret
was that he had never been at a public school; the Colonel, who was
once at Eton, laments that he suffers from a neglected education.
Burnand, who succeeded to the editorship of _Punch_ in 1880, was also
an old Etonian, but was not on that account prepared to grant his old
school a complete immunity from criticism. The "Diary of a Present
Etonian," which appeared in 1885, is in the main jocularly descriptive,
but illustrates a prevalent Philistinism, the habits of ragging and
borrowing money, and tells of a week with only one whole school-day
and two whole holidays. Yet while fully alive to the waste of time and
money which went on at the public schools, _Punch_ was very far from
embracing the creed of the revolutionary utilitarians who would scrap
the old curriculum wholesale. In 1887 he printed an ironic account of
the "Public School of the Future," thoroughly impregnated with the
Commercial Spirit. The hero, the new "Tom Brown," develops a talent for
finance so remarkable that his father longs to see him loose on the
Stock Exchange.

_Punch_ did not believe in compulsory classics, because he disliked
dons, pedants and academics; but in his parody of "The Isles of Greece"
from the point of view of a British schoolboy, he made it abundantly
clear that he had no love of the purely commercial "bread-study" view
of Education:--

    Oh feed me not on mythic lore,
      But Science and the Modern Fact;
    Teach me Electric Fires to store,
      The difference 'twixt "Bill" and "Act."
    Why should a Cockney care a "cuss"
    For Homer or for Æschylus?

    For who _are_ they? But what art thou,
      My Country? On thy fertile shore
    The heroic lyre is tuneless now;
      To scheme for dividends, dig for ore,
    _These_ are the things we hold divine,
    Not Homer's long-resounding line.

In dealing with University Education _Punch_ maintained his attitude
of a moderate reformer. Keble College, Oxford, dates from 1870; in
1878 _Punch_ twice over displays a keen hostility to the Anglican
spirit of its founders and the "gingerbread and gilt" of Butterfield's
architecture. He seizes the occasion to belittle Keble's poetry, to
attack Pusey, Burgon and Liddon, and to describe the college in the
following contemptuous quatrain:--

    Half withdrawn in ways ascetic,
      Half with modern notions stirring;
    Half athletic, half æsthetic,
      Neither fish, flesh nor red herring.

_Punch_ did not share the late Canon Liddon's pessimism over the new
Science degree at Oxford in 1879. Liddon is quoted as saying that
without the habits of exactness and precision acquired by classical
studies it was impossible to reach the higher characteristics of
an educated man. The argument was naturally resented by those who
maintained that "exactness and precision" were precisely the qualities
inculcated by scientific training, and in an ironical dialogue _Punch_
derides specialization as compared with the "humanities." In 1885 the
neglect of English literature at the older Universities is satirized in
the picture of the undergraduate reading out his illiterate letter, in
which the first and third persons are hopelessly mixed up.

In 1886 the spread of free education to the Universities is
foreshadowed in a description of the Slade Professor at Oxford
lecturing to a mixed audience of coal-heavers and undergraduates;
and the "Progressists' Calendar" indicates a revolt of Ratepayers
against their new burdens. In the same year the "Studies from
_Punch's_ Studio" include a portrait of the new type of University
don. "Wyckham of Jude's," who displays much versatile energy and
a wide range of interests--athletics, music, philosophy, Browning
and psychical research--ultimately goes to Australia as a Professor
of Greek. The reference to "Eleutheria Hall" foreshadows Ruskin
College, which was founded in 1899, and in other ways _Punch's_
fancy portraiture illustrates the changes which had come over the
spirit of Oxford's dream. We note, for example, the allusion to the
new cosmopolitanism--the invasion of foreigners, white and coloured,
anticipating the time some thirty years later which gave birth to one
of the best of modern Oxford anecdotes. A film was being exhibited
showing a large canoe manned by Hawaiian natives, whereon a voice arose
from the audience, "Well rowed, Balliol!"

[Sidenote: _The Value of Modern Languages_]

The proposal, since realized, to introduce Agriculture as a subject
for study at Oxford is jocularly treated early in 1887 in the form of
a diary of a candidate who is ploughed for his unorthodox views on
potato culture. As for modern languages, the advantages of a foreign
education--social and artistic as well as commercial--are excellently
summed up in the same year in Du Maurier's picture of the industrious
and accomplished young man from Hamburg, who is not only a skilled
pianist but can speak six languages, live on a pound a week, work
eighteen hours out of the twenty-four, and do without a holiday!

       *       *       *       *       *

[Illustration: ADVANTAGES OF A FOREIGN EDUCATION

In 1875 _Punch_ dwelt sympathetically on the still surviving prevalence
of classical learning amongst statesmen. The occasion was furnished by
Disraeli's florid eulogy of the imagination of the English School of
Art at the Royal Academy banquet:--

                     "HE TOO WAS BORN IN ARCADIA"

           (Matthew Arnold on Disraeli at the R.A. Dinner).

    Born in Arcadia! Ay, he knew
    Pan's cloven foot-print on the dew,
    And heard, the mystic woods across,
    Aigipod[=e]s, Philokrotos,
    "The bright-haired god of pastoral,"[4]
    With pipings to his wood-nymphs call.
    Yes, but a nobler sound there came--
    The clarion of imperial Fame,
    By which our greatest are withdrawn
    From the serene Arcadian lawn.

    Derby and Gladstone felt the breeze
    That urged their sails to Homer's seas;
    Yet in the Senate found their fate,
    And drank the hot wine of debate.
    Perish the thought that England's realm
    Should e'er have dullards at the helm!
    Far from us be the stolid serf
    Who ne'er has trod Arcadian turf,
    Nor heard, amid the glimmering trees,
    Pan's happy Orestiades.

 [Footnote 4: Chapman: Homeric Hymns.]

  Probably the exigencies of the metre are responsible for the strange
  lapse which made _Punch_ substitute "Orestiades" for "Oreades." Greek
  was not then in the "last ditch," though the following advertisement,
  which _Punch_ reproduces in the same year, seems to show that its
  study did not conduce to opulence:--

  A Bachelor, elderly and somewhat infirm, having a moderate
  acquaintance with the Latin and Greek languages and who is
  likewise expert with a weeding hoe, seeks a HOME and
  EMPLOYMENT. A bracing air and easy access to the services of
  the Church indispensable.--Address, &c.

Nowadays one of our leading literary weeklies talks of the "Hyperion
Spring." But as early as 1891 the question of Compulsory Greek was
attracting a good deal of attention, and _Punch_ sided with _The
Times_ in expressing his disbelief in "protected studies." He also
took occasion to criticize the narrowness of the old curriculum in his
picture deriding the ignorance of Dante shown by classical students. It
is just as well that he heads the picture "Too much Greek," for no good
Virgilian would ever have laid himself open to such a charge.

[Sidenote: _Too Much Greek_]

[Illustration: THE RESULT OF TOO MUCH GREEK

SECOND CLASSIC: "Yes; Alfieri, I think--or else Alighieri."

FIRST CLASSIC: "Ah, perhaps you're right. I had a notion it
was Gabriel Rossetti, or something!"]

At the beginning of this period _Punch_ undoubtedly showed a good deal
of mistrust of the new methods of elementary education, in so far
as they encouraged literary aspirations among the masses and tended
to convert the artisan into the clerk. At its close he strikes a
different and decidedly more democratic note in his ironical proposed
"inscription for a Free Public Library" under the heading, "_Laissez
Faire_":--

    Here is an Institution doomed to scare
    The furious devotees of _Laissez Faire_.
    What mental shock, indeed, could prove immenser
    To Mumbo Jumbo--or to Herbert Spencer?
    Free Books? Reading provided from the Rates?
    Oh, that means Freedom's ruin, and the State's!
    Self-help's all right--e'en if you rob a brother--
    But human creatures must not help each other!
    The "Self-made Man," whom Samuel Smiles so praises,
    Who on his fellows' necks his footing raises,
    The systematic "Sweater," who sucks wealth
    From toiling crowds by cunning and by stealth--
    He is all right, he has no maudlin twist,
    He does not shock the Individualist!
    But rate yourselves to give the poor free reading?
    The Pelican to warm her nestlings bleeding,
    Was no such monument of feeble folly.
    Let folks alone, and all will then be jolly.
    Let the poor perish, let the ignorant sink,
    The tempted tumble, and the drunkard drink!
    Let--no, don't let the low-born robber rob,
    Because--well, that would rather spoil the job.
    If footpad-freedom brooked no interference,
    Of Capital there might be a great clearance;
    But, Wealth well-guarded, let all else alone,
    'Tis thus our race hath to true manhood grown:
    To make the general good the common care,
    Breaks through the sacred law of _Laissez Faire_!

_Laissez Faire_ in the family circle was another matter. The authority
of the father in domestic affairs is represented as still unquestioned
even by the mother as late as 1879. But, just as you can always find
proverbs which are mutually contradictory the one of the other, so
the pages of _Punch_ constantly provide simultaneous illustrations
of opposing tendencies. In the very same year in which the doctrine
of patriarchal rule is shown to be still firmly established, _Punch_
exhibits a highly modern aspect of the relations between the two
generations. Squire Quiverfull's son, who pays 60s. a hundred for his
cigars, rebukes his father for paying 3d. each for _his_: "If I had as
many children to provide for as you, I wouldn't smoke at all."




                       RELIGION AND THE CHURCHES

In the previous volume it was shown how _Punch_ ranged himself on the
side of the determined Protestantism of the mass of the English people
against the growth of Ritualistic opinions and practices in the Church
of England.

The tone of _Punch's_ remonstrances was not always judicious or
considerate, and it would be easy to overrate their influence. Still,
they were not unrepresentative, and undoubtedly played a part in the
movement which led to the introduction in the spring of 1874 of the
Archbishops' Bill for the Regulation of Public Worship. As it was
originally drafted, the directory power as to worship was given to
the Bishop, assisted by a board of Assessors, clerical and lay, with
an appeal to the Archbishop with a Board of Assessors whose decision
should be final. The provisions of the Bill were criticized by Lord
Salisbury, the Bishop of Peterborough, and Lord Shaftesbury, but of the
amendments proposed those of Lord Shaftesbury carried the day, viz.
that an Ecclesiastical Judge should preside in the Courts of Canterbury
and York, to be appointed by the two Archbishops with the approval of
the Crown, and that before this Judge, and not before the Bishop, such
case of complaint, if not dismissed by the Bishop as frivolous, was
to go for trial; one appeal should lie from this Judge to the Privy
Council. These amendments gave the final character to the Act.

So far the Ministers had not committed themselves, and grave
differences of opinion were known to exist in the Cabinet. On the
introduction of the Bill into the Commons further cross-currents were
revealed. Mr. Gladstone declared uncompromising war on the Bill, on the
ground that it was not asked for by the Bishops, and as now modified
was "manufactured not by the two Primates but by members of Parliament
independently of them"; that it lacked weight and authority; and gave
undue powers to indiscreet Bishops. He accordingly formulated six
resolutions embodying the principles which ought to guide legislation
on the subject. Sir William Harcourt followed, vigorously traversing
his late leader's argument, and defending the Bill. His "Erastian
Manifesto" was so favourably received by the House that Disraeli, in a
remarkable speech, made it clear that the Government had adopted the
Bill. It was in this speech that he declared that it "would be wise for
us to rally on the broad platform of the Reformation." As long as the
doctrines relating to the worship of the Virgin, or the Confessional
were held by Roman Catholics, he was prepared to treat them with
reverence. "What I do object to is Mass in masquerade."

The second reading was carried without a division; on the following
day Mr. Gladstone withdrew his resolutions; and large majorities
confirmed the principal clauses in Committee. When the Bill came back
from the Lords, Disraeli gave way on an important amendment dealing
with the question of appeal, which the Commons had introduced and the
Lords had thrown out; he repeated that the Bill was intended "to put
down Ritualism"; incidentally he described Lord Salisbury, who had
repudiated "the bugbear of a majority of the House of Commons," as
"a great master of gibes and flouts and jeers," but appealed to the
House not to fall into the trap and lose the Bill by gratifying their
_amour-propre_. The appeal was not in vain; the Commons without a
division decided not to insist on their amendment, and the Bill which
was appointed to come into operation in July, 1875, was read a third
time on August 3. It is hard to say whether Sir William Harcourt's
panegyrics of Disraeli, or Disraeli's sarcasms at the expense of Lord
Salisbury caused more remark.

[Sidenote: _Gladstone on Vatican Decrees_]

But a more sensational sequel of the debates in Parliament was provided
by Mr. Gladstone's article on Ritualism in the October _Contemporary_
and his pamphlet issued in November on _The Vatican Decrees_. By
the former, in which he insisted on the hopelessness of the attempt
to Romanize the Church and people of England, he provoked the Irish
Romanist journals to fury and indignation. The reverberations of the
_Vatican Decrees_ pamphlet were even wider. For Mr. Gladstone was
not content with assailing the Papal claim to Infallibility: he went
so far as to say that "it was a political misfortune that during the
last thirty years the Roman Catholic Church should have acquired such
an extension of its hold upon the highest classes of this country."
The conquests had been chiefly among women, "but the number of male
converts, or captives (as I might prefer to call them), has not been
inconsiderable."

Gladstone's challenge was taken up both by Ultramontane and Liberal
Catholic champions, lay and clerical, with the result that the latter
disowned the former, and their conflicting answers revealed an
extraordinary divergence of opinion among the professing members of
the Roman Church. The views of Cardinal Manning and Lord Acton were
irreconcilable; and Manning's circular issued at the end of November
amounted to an excommunication of the followers of Döllinger, the
famous German "modernist" whom Gladstone had visited earlier in the
year, and who had been excommunicated himself in 1871 for refusing to
subscribe to the Vatican decrees. But Döllinger had refused to allow
himself to be consecrated a bishop of the old Catholic Church, and
though by conviction he belonged to the old Catholic Community he never
formally joined them.

The Ultramontane organs in Rome ascribed Gladstone's pamphlet to the
alarm occasioned by the progress Romanism was making in England,
and even hinted that his attacks were designed to clear himself of
the suspicion of hidden Catholicism, which he had incurred by his
conversations with Döllinger. This brief sketch of current theological
controversy in 1874 may assist us in recognizing the incentives which
animated _Punch's_ continued attacks on High Anglicans and Ritualists.
At the close of 1875 he quotes the following from the _Church Times_:--

  "We regret to observe that that 'chartered libertine,' the Dean of
 Westminster, has once more degraded the venerable church which is so
  unfortunate as to be committed to his charge, by making its nave a
lecture room in which Nonconformist Ministers may disport themselves."

The same organ described the service in the Abbey on St. Andrew's Day
as "Dr. Moffatt's entertainment," and _Punch_ asks, "if this is High
Church pleasantry, what is Low?" In 1876, when communion was refused on
account of the would-be communicant's disbelief in the Devil, _Punch_
observes:--

    The cleric mind in quarrels seems to revel.
    Devil or none, some clerks will play the Devil.

[Illustration: AT THE CATTLE SHOW

(_A Troublesome Lot._)]

The intransigent attitude of the High Church party towards
Nonconformists is condemned with equal frankness when a Cornish vicar
repudiated the title of Reverend as it was "desecrated" by the "carrion
of dissent." In the same year the Rev. Arthur Tooth, of Hatcham, was
inhibited by the Dean of Arches, and _Punch_ warns Mother Church that
she will have no peace till she has got rid of this tooth. The familiar
line of argument is adopted that he was neither a sound Anglican nor a
true Romanist, and his church is called "St. James's (Colney) Hatcham."
Frequent and unflattering allusions to a manual entitled, _The Priest
in Absolution_, occur in 1877; and ironical comment is passed on the
suggestion made in the Lower House of Convocation, that vestments might
be allowed as from a distance they were not distinguishable from a
surplice.

Mr. Mackonochie's continued recalcitrancy also occupied _Punch's_
attention a good deal in 1877. In December he explains the views on
canonical obedience of the Vicar of St. Alban's, Holborn, as follows:--

  When a Ritualist has gone on too long playing at Popery, he may,
  through impaired biliary function affecting the sensorium, finally
  contract a subjective delusion, induced upon his dominant fixed idea
  that he is his own Pope, etc.

A week later, when Mr. Mackonochie was reported to have withdrawn
into a Retreat, _Punch_ kindly suggests that in earlier ages it
would have been Anticyra--the town celebrated for hellebore, the
chief remedy in antiquity for madness. Later on he gives specimens,
under the heading of "Obedientia Docet," of correspondence from
Mackonochie's Letter Writer to meet the situation of a subaltern
reprimanded by his colonel, a stockbroker replying to a client who
has objected to an investment effected on his credit, etc.--in all
of which insubordination and disregard of orders and instructions
are casuistically defended. On matters of doctrine and discipline
_Punch_ differed acutely from Archdeacon Denison, but he greeted the
publication of his _Notes of My Life_ affectionately, holding the
author to be "most optimist of pessimists, John Bullest of John Bulls."
In 1879 under the heading, "Coronatus, non Pileatus," _Punch_ applauds
Newman's refusal of a cardinal's hat, accompanying his approval with a
back-handed sarcastic reference to Manning, who had accepted the honour
in 1875. Manning's instructions for the observance of Lent are roughly
handled in the lines which end,

    Will the great Lord Cardinal kindly make known
    On what day, if any, our souls are our own?

But this was practically the Swan-song of _Punch's_ no-Popery campaign.
Lord Salisbury, in his speech on the Public Worship Regulation Bill,
had spoken of three schools of religious thought--the Sacramental, the
Emotional and the Philosophical. Henceforth and for a good many years
to come _Punch_ was mainly concerned with the two latter schools, and
most of all with the second. He reverted with undiminished vigour
to his old campaign against the Sabbatarians, but his chief _bête
noire_ was the Salvation Army. Here he was at one with Huxley in
his criticisms on "Corybantic Christianity," but for the rest he
impartially combated the pretensions of scientific dogmatism, of
Agnosticism (which he called the Nothingarian creed) and Positivism. He
warns France against the danger of a purely secularist education:--

    An Atheist's "The Fool"--the Psalmist saith:
      Will France risk such a brood of Fools?
    Irreverent youth, with neither Hope nor Faith,
      Will be the product of your Godless Schools.

[Sidenote: _Sunday Observance_]

He satirizes the advocates of undenominationalism in the picture of the
toy-shop man who declines to supply a Noah's Ark to a lady customer.
He had given up keeping them since School Boards came in: "They was
considered too denominational, M'um."

[Illustration: TOYS AND THEIR TEACHINGS

LADY CUSTOMER: "My little boy wishes for a Noah's Ark. Have
you one?"

TOYMAN: "No, M'um, no. We've given up keeping Noah's
Harks since the School Boards come in. They was considered too
denominational, M'um!"]

As for the keeping of Sunday, _Punch_ eulogizes Canon Basil Wilberforce
for encouraging Sunday bands, and contrasts his tolerance with the
attitude of a Dr. Watts, of Belfast, who objected to Sunday bathing:
"It was not necessary for a man to bath himself every morning. He did
not see, therefore, why it was necessary to open public baths on the
Sabbath morning." The Sunday opening of the picture galleries at the
Royal Manchester Institution proved a conspicuous success in 1880.
Those who opposed the experiment had been, if not silenced, confuted,
and _Punch_ entreated London to follow this excellent lead and not
stand _last_ in the Sunday Race between Public House and Public Gallery.

So when the Tay Bridge disaster was regarded by the Sabbatarian
zealots as a direct judgment on Sunday travelling, _Punch_ dealt with
them as they deserved:--

  One of these self-sufficient judges of judgments, and complacent
  dealers out of denunciations, converting the awful catastrophe
  triumphantly to the account of his own black and bitter creed--in
  which the Almighty figures as a sort of Ashantee Fetish, to be
  propitiated by death and destruction--has no hesitation in putting
  his finger on its immediate cause. Referring to the imprisoned
  passengers--men, women, and little children--many of them known to
  have been on their way to or from errands of friendship, mercy and
  family affection--he asks whether it was not "awful to think" that--

  "They had been carried away when many of them must have known that
  they were transgressing the law of God."

It might do this gentleman some good to reflect that it is possible to
be "carried away" in another fashion, and to transgress a great law of
God--"Judge not that ye be not judged," in a more questionable manner.
To see the professing minister of a religion, of whose virtues one of
its leading Apostles has declared charity the greatest, swept off his
narrow line of literal sectarianism in a hurricane of bitter bigotry,
is suggestive of reflections which, if not exactly "awful," are neither
agreeable nor edifying.

[Sidenote: _Sunday Pastime and Sunday Closing_]

In the lines on "Our Sunday--down East"--permission to include which in
the programme of any Sabbatarian Penny Reading was freely granted by
_Punch_--he writes:--

    Which is the day that _should_ be blest,
    And to the weary, work-opprest,
    Bring wholesome pleasure, peace, and rest?
            Our Sunday.

    Yet which the day of all the seven
    To our sour lives adds sourer leaven,
    And leaves poor folk most far from heaven?
            Our Sunday.

The persistence of the Sabbatarian instinct, even where it was
disregarded, is illustrated in the picture of the young lady on a
railway platform asking her grandfather to hide their rackets: "We
needn't show everybody that we are going to play lawn tennis on a
Sunday afternoon."

When in 1888 Sunday boating was allowed in the parks after church
time, _Punch_ applauds "George Ranger" and Mr. David Plunket for
the _act_ but not the language of the order, which he condemns as
"Pharisaical trash." In the same year a largely signed petition was
laid before the Upper House of Convocation of Canterbury protesting
against the increasing pursuit of Sunday pastime by the "upper and
fashionable classes of Society." _Punch_ ridicules the vagueness of the
protest against "amusing programmes of fun and frolic," and sums up in
these words:--

  Our English Sunday is none too lovely or lively an institution, but
  as yet neither the upper nor the lower classes of English Society
  have shown any tendency, publicly, to desecrate it. When they do, it
  will be time enough, if not for the Upper House of the Convocation of
  Canterbury, at least for the Public Opinion of the country to express
  itself upon the matter. Meantime, grandmotherly interference had
  better let it alone.

_Punch_ had evidently modified his earlier views as to the saving grace
of Sunday dullness in England as compared with the Continental Sunday.
The Bill for the Sunday closing of public-houses introduced in 1889
is dealt with in detail and at great length. The cartoon of "Sunday à
la Pharisee" aims at showing that the habitual toper will not suffer,
but that the decent working-man will be incommoded. It is rather
unfortunate, however, that the latter is shown sending his little girl
to the public-house for his beer. The accompanying verses are founded
on a wonderful fulmination in _The Times_:--

  "To hedge people round with petty restrictions instead of teaching
  them nobility of conduct and a worthy use of liberty, is the perennial
  resource of shallow and incompetent reformers.... A depraved and
  servile human nature, cribbed, cabined and confined by an infinity of
  minute regulations enforced by the policemen, is their reading of the
  social problem.... A small minority occasionally injure themselves
  with bad liquor on Sunday, and these reformers can think of nothing
  better than to forbid the entire Community to drink on Sundays at
    all."

_Punch_ descants rhetorically for nearly one hundred lines on Smugby's
Sabbath, fanaticism, Pharisaism, etc., but as a Londoner he had
probably never witnessed the orgies of the Glasgow Fair. He never
failed to insist on the intemperateness of Temperance reformers, but
as a supporter of moderate drinking he was himself often guilty of
immoderate language.

In regard to anti-Semitism, another of his pet aversions in this
period, his record is far less open to criticism. He made a perfectly
fair point in representing men of Jewish extraction as the chief
offenders, for these were the days of the _Libre Parole_, edited by
Drumont, himself a renegade Jew, and of the anti-Semitic campaign in
France which reached its climax in the Dreyfus "affair" in the middle
'nineties. As early as 1881, in one of Du Maurier's pictures, Sir
Gorgius Midas is backed up in a tirade against the Jews by "Baron
von Meyer," who, with the stigmata of his race written all over him,
flatters himself that nobody can suspect his origin. In the cartoon on
the Jewish "pogroms" in Russia in 1882, Humanity, compared to a Portia
who pleads _for_ and not _against_ the Jews, is shown appealing to the
Tsar, who stands with his back turned and arms crossed. How would it
read in English, _Punch_ asks, if our papers contained accounts of the
murdering of Jews and the burning of their houses in Houndsditch, with
the police looking on in amused indifference, and the Home Secretary
sending messages of thanks to the murderers?

In the verses published in January, 1882, "A Cry from Christendom,"
against the old anti-Semitic cry of "Hep! Hep!" _Punch_ indignantly
denounces the hounding down of the Hebrew in the name of the Cross:--

    Oh out on the Tartuffes of Creed! Let the spirit of Christendom
      speak
    Plain words of unfaltering truth for the cause of the helpless and
      weak.

[Sidenote: _Punch's Toleration_]

No warnings of possible retaliation come from _Punch_; such a
possibility did not enter into the calculations of sympathizers with
the oppressed Jews, who were regarded as incapable of effective
resistance. A different aspect of the question is satirized in
references to Society "mariages de convenance" with rich Jewesses,
probably not unconnected with a recent notable alliance between a
distinguished peer and the daughter of a great Jewish house. _Punch's_
general view, however, was that expressed in the saying that "every
country has the Jews which it deserves," and he was ready to admit
that the good English Jews were very good indeed. In 1883 he published
Sambourne's portrait of Sir Moses Montefiore, a Hebrew of the Hebrews,
"who on the 8th day of Chesvan (November 8) entered on the hundredth
year of his blameless, brave and beneficent life"; and when the old man
died in the summer of 1885 _Punch_ paid him farewell homage in these
lines:--

    Long in the land his days, whose heart and hand
    All high and human causes could command;
    Long in the land his memory will abide
    His country's treasure, and his people's pride.

In 1886 _Punch_ vociferously applauded Dean Bradley, Stanley's
successor, for "his admirable answer to the three fanatical
Protestant-defence Secretaries, who would have forcibly ejected from
Westminster Abbey some Roman Catholics who were saying their private
prayers around the 'strong quadrilateral barrier of bronze,' which, as
stated by Canon Duckworth, protects the tomb of Edward the Confessor
from profane hands." He improves the occasion by some general remarks
aimed at Protestant visitors to Roman Catholic churches on the
Continent:--

  _Mr. Punch_ heartily wishes that the conduct of English Protestants
  visiting the Catholic Churches abroad were anything like as
  inoffensive, and as appropriate to the sacred precincts, as was that
  of the poor benighted Romanists in Westminster Abbey, who, thinking
  that the best use to which a church could be put was to say prayers in
  it, knelt and prayed accordingly.

After rebuking the insolent caddishness of ill-bred British tourists
which not only offended the congregation proper, but scandalized their
decent compatriots, _Punch_ continues:--

  If Dean _Punch_ saw a hundred 'Arrys, Romans or Rum 'uns of any sort,
  praying in Westminster Abbey would he interfere? No, bless 'em,
  certainly not. But if he saw one of them sneaking out a pencil to
  scribble his name on a monument, or attempting to nick a bit out of a
  shrine, or off a tomb, he'd be down upon him then and there, and have
  him up before the nearest police-magistrate charged with "maliciously
  damaging," and fined heavily for the offence, no matter what his
  excellent motive might have been for such wanton destruction. And
  this is what the Dean and Chapter would do, too; for whether it be a
  fanatic on one side or the other, law and order must not be set aside
  in favour of such a rule as "_Omne ignotum pro Fanatico_."

The doctrine is excellent if the language is jocular. But _Punch's_
plea for tolerance is seriously impaired by the virulent hostility with
which he had for years assailed the Salvation Army and its founder. It
is true that he had always discouraged and discountenanced emotional
religion. The visit of Moody and Sankey in 1875 had drawn from him a
set of acid verses on "Missionaries in Motley." After describing their
methods, he continues:--

    Their intent is sincere--let us trust, in all charity--
    But Religion they cloak in the garb of Vulgarity,
    And, under a visor of seeming profanity,
    As comic evangelists, preach Christianity.

    Those discourses of theirs are an exaggeration
    Of the jocular species of pulpit oration,
    Which was brought into vogue by that eminent surgeon
    And physician of souls to the multitude, Spurgeon.
    An impressible people are they that sit under
    These 'cute Boanerges, these smart sons of thunder,
    Who cause them, at will, to sing psalm or doxology
    By an influence much like electro-biology.
    Ira Sankey performs, as a musical Stentor,
    To the _mobile vulgus_ the part of Precentor.
    His remarkable name may suggest the inquiry
    If he ever exhorts them to sing "_Dies Iræ_?"
    _Quorsum hæc_? Can tomfoolery kindle true piety?
    Maybe so. Human nature is fond of variety.
    Mr. Merriman's unctuous sallies might irk us,
    But although a Revival American Circus,
    Ira Clown in the Ring, decent people would anger,
    Couldn't Moody and Sankey join Hengler and Sanger?
    If it didn't conduce much to edification,
    It would probably pay, as a good speculation.

[Sidenote: _Punch and the Salvation Army_]

The verses gave such offence that _Punch_ was moved to publish an
explanation a week later, disclaiming any intention to throw any doubts
on the motives or the sincerity of the American Evangelists, but
maintaining his right to criticize what he honestly believed to be bad
taste in the style and manner of their appeals.

Let it be granted that there was much in the early methods of the
Salvation Army that provoked opposition and caused the judicious
to grieve. The outrageous familiarity with which the most sacred
names and subjects were treated in the _War Cry_; the conversion of
the most popular songs into hymn tunes; the military organization,
uniforms and titles; the "allonging and marshonging" with big drums
and trombones--all these features affronted and disgusted good people
who associated worship with privacy and reticence; while the hooligans
looked on the Salvationists as sour-faced Puritans, and organized a
"Skeleton Army" to break up their meetings. Collisions were frequent,
and throughout the 'eighties members of the Salvation Army were fined
and even imprisoned as disturbers of the public peace. Those of us who
are old enough to remember these scenes can well recall the impression
which the Salvationists made upon the detached observer of forty years
ago. Men and women and girls, they wore the set look of people who had
espoused an unpopular and even perilous cause and were resolved to
carry it through. They seldom looked happy, and they had little cause
for it. In ten years the physiognomy of the Salvationists had changed,
and they went about their work unmolested with serene and cheerful
faces. _Punch_ could at least plead this extenuation of his hostility,
that it was shared by learned and excellent men. But there is really
no excuse for his childish exultation over the Queen's refusal to
subscribe to the Salvation Army's funds in 1882, and his jeers at the
Archbishop of Canterbury for investing "his modest fiver in the Booth
Bank."

The prophecy in which he indulged in that year in an article headed,
"Bootheration to 'Em," is worth quoting. _Punch_ regretted the
conversion of the Grecian Theatre--"a place of generally harmless
recreation for the East End"--into a temple of Salvationism:--

  Yet we feel certain that the Army, once possessed of a great
  permanent meeting-place, will speedily convert it into some sort of
  Conventicle, the excitement of "drums and excursions" will gradually
  cease, conservatism will increase, Respectability and recognition by
  Respectability will be the object of the majority, reformers will
  arise and "camp out," regiments will desert, and some twenty new Sects
  will be added to the list of the country which possesses "any number
  of religions and only one sauce."

Part of the prophecy has been fulfilled; the concluding part, in which
the wish was father to the thought, has been falsified. For _Punch_ in
these days only saw hysteria and vulgarity in what he considered an
unhealthy mania. He seized on the repellent features of the crusade,
e.g. the song, "On Board of the 'Allelujah," issued by "Admiral
Tug" of the Salvation Navy--and overlooked the sincere and devoted
efforts at social reclamation which underlay these exuberances. Mr.
Justice Field's decision in June, 1882, allowing Salvationists to hold
processions and parades was deplored as likely to encourage all the
strange sects enumerated in _Whitaker's Almanack_--Jumpers, Shakers,
Mormons and Recreative Religionists--to go and do likewise. The verses
printed in November, 1883, are a bitter and violent tirade against the
movement in general and the Booth family in particular, with offensive
references to "dear Catherine ... blushing so feminine" who had been
arrested by a Swiss magistrate:--

    All the world knows we're so blessedly 'umble--
      (How like the Master we follow so well!)--
    That for a Booth there's no chance of a tumble,
      Though e'en the Temple of Solomon fell.

[Sidenote: _Hostility to General Booth_]

"Atlas" of the _World_ denounced the "Salvation Army nuisance" in the
autumn of 1884. It had spoilt a season at Worthing and might do so at
Brighton. _Punch_, welcoming the pious Mr. Edmund Yates as an ally,
proposed as a remedy the prohibition of _all_ processions, excepting
only those of State requirements, as a relic of barbarism and an
anachronism:--

  Let the Salvation Army, with their ensigns and captains and uniforms,
  and drums and trumpets, assemble in their Barracks just as Christians,
  Jews, Turks and Heathens do in their Churches, Synagogues, Mosques
  and Temples; and let their recruiting sergeants go about where they
  list, or where they are likely to 'list; but let this out-of-door
  _irreligious_ movement, this outrageous travesty of _Ecclesiastical
  symbolism_, with its fanatic war-cries, its fanfares, its martial
  hymns, and brass-band accompaniment, leading to riot and bloodshed on
  the Lord's Day, let this be forthwith suppressed, as it can be, we
  believe, by existing law; and if not, let the law be made. Of course
  that harmless body of publicans and sinners, the Freemasons, would be
  sufferers by such a regulation; but with His Royal Highness of Wales,
  their Grand Master, at their head, they would be willing to bear the
  privation of being occasionally deprived of an open-air display of
  sashes, aprons and emblems for the sake of law and order.

_Punch's_ animosity towards the Salvationists showed little abatement
right on into the 'nineties. General Booth was twice caricatured: in
1885 as "His own Trumpeter" blowing an instrument like a French horn
in mid air, and in 1892 as "General Boombastes"--a composite title
of derision founded on Bombastes Furioso and General Boum of the
_Grande Duchesse_--in connexion with a great demonstration held by
the Salvation Army in Hyde Park in February of that year. Sarcastic
references occur from time to time to the finance of the Army, which
in those years lent itself to criticism. But science and intellect,
cynicism and fastidiousness were routed or converted in the sequel.
The Salvation Army came nearer success in reclaiming "the submerged
tenth" than any other sect or church: it outlived derision, criticism
and scepticism, and earned the tribute of imitation in the organization
of the Church Army. No finer example of this conversion is to be found
than in the life of Frank Crossley, the senior partner in the great
Manchester engineering firm, that noble and benevolent philanthropist,
who began in antipathy to the methods of the Salvation Army and
devoted the end of his life to intimate, self-sacrificing and cordial
co-operation with them in the slums of Ancoats.

Burnand, who succeeded to the editorship of _Punch_ in 1880, was
a Roman Catholic; but it cannot be asserted that he abused his
opportunities any more than Charles Cooper, who was a Romanist when
he joined the editorial staff of the _Scotsman_, a much more delicate
position for a member of that communion. _Punch_ became perhaps less
aggressively Protestant, but there was no substantial change in the
theological policy of the paper, or in its mainly Erastian attitude in
regard to the relations of Church and State. No serious exception can
be taken to the verdict on the Revised Version--completed in 1880--as
"a very qualified success if not an absolute failure," coupled with a
wish to know what were the suggestions for improvements made by our
American cousins. The verses in the same year on "A Life's Work and a
Life's Wage," recounting the sad experience of a Devonshire curate who
after thirty years' work, applied for an order to enter the workhouse
as a pauper--are only a renewal of _Punch's_ familiar complaints on
the scandal of underpaid clergy. Eleven years later, in 1891, he takes
up the same parable _à propos_ of a statement by Mr. Gladstone to the
effect that "if the priest is to live, he must beg, earn or steal,"
comparing the needy vicar, with eighty pounds a year, and the bishop
with five thousand. Yet in the same number, under the heading of
"Mitred Misery," _Punch_ has an article on the heavy and extortionate
fees incurred by bishops on their installation or translation. The
victim is represented as just managing to meet the expenses of his
elevation to one episcopal see and his translation to another, but
declining an archbishopric on the ground that it would land him
in the Bankruptcy Court. In an earlier year the contrast between
the well-to-do cleric and the poor is ironically emphasized in the
"Consolation" administered by Mr. Dean: "Ah, my poor fellow, your case
is very sad, no doubt! But remember that the rich have their troubles
too. I dare say, now, _you_ can scarcely realize what it is not to know
where to find an investment which will combine adequate security with a
decent interest on one's money."

[Sidenote: _Disestablishment_]

Doctrinal opportunism is satirized in Du Maurier's picture of the
vicar of a seaside town who was "High Church during the season, and
Low all the rest of the year." Much in the same spirit is the list
of qualifications necessary for a curate in a country parish: the
chief desideratum being that he must be able to play tennis with the
vicar's daughters. These jests were almost common form at the close
of the Victorian age. A more serious situation arose in 1885 owing
to the demand for Disestablishment put forward by the Radicals, but
_Punch_ refused to treat it seriously. His cartoon, "A False Alarm,"
shows a chorus of Conservative owls--including Lord Salisbury and Mr.
Cross--crying, "Too-whit, too-whoo, Church in Danger."

[Illustration: "TEMPORA MUTANTUR"

THE BISHOP (_to his youngest and favourite son_): "Now, why
shouldn't you adopt the _stage_ as a profession, Theodore? Lord Ronald
Beaumanoir, who's a year younger than yourself, is already getting
_sixteen guineas a week_ for low comedy parts at the Criterion! The
duchess told me so herself only yesterday!"]

_Punch_ appends an extract from a speech by Mr. Chamberlain expressing
his incredulity of any settlement of this question being arrived at in
the Parliament about to assemble. This view is further developed in
a burlesque forecast, "The Disestablisher's Diary," with sensational
and circumstantial details of the passing of Disestablishment, the
conversion of Westminster Abbey into a Coffee Hall, bishops begging in
the streets, riots of country clergy, etc. In 1887 the scheme of the
late Dean, then Archdeacon or "Harsh Deacon" Farrar (as _Punch_ called
him), for a Church House as a Jubilee memorial roused _Punch's_ violent
animosity. It was giving a stone to those who needed bread--the poor
clergy. In the cartoon on "Mammon the mendicant," who was sending round
the hat, John Bull declines to give anything to the seedy cleric for
the Church House: "I'd rather put it into your own [hat]."

A long article is devoted in 1890 to the trial of Bishop King of
Lincoln, but beyond facetious descriptions of the eminent counsel
engaged the only point made is that the bishop never came near the
place. In the same year another bishop, Dr. Jayne of Chester, earned
_Punch's_ unstinted approval for encouraging dancing among the working
classes. At a conference of the Girls' Friendly Society the bishop had
remarked that, "until they were prepared to introduce basket-making
into London Society as a substitute for quadrilles and waltzes he was
not disposed to accept it as an equivalent for balls and dances among
girls of other classes." This liberality of view prompted _Punch_ to
cut a series of ecstatic capers over the pluck and common sense of "my
pithy Jayne."

In agreeable contrast to these punning comments on Church matters are
the tributes to two remarkable men, widely sundered in temperament,
physique and doctrine, who both passed away in January, 1892. The
memorial lines on Cardinal Manning insist that he was much more than

    A great priest, shrewd marshaller of men,
    Subtle in verbal fence with tongue or pen,
            Ascetic of the cell--

He is extolled as the friend of the poor, the struggling weak, the
toiler for temperance, the hastener on of light:--

    In many a fray when Right's at odds with Might,
    Might's foes will miss their friend.

[Sidenote: _Homage to Spurgeon_]

It should be remembered that _Punch_ did not easily applaud Temperance
advocates in this period, when he avowed himself as "capable of special
sympathy with the publicans." _Punch_ owed an _amende_ to Spurgeon as
well as to Manning, and made it handsomely. He recognizes Spurgeon's
sturdiness and geniality:--

                You spoke a potent word
    In the World's ear and listening thousands heard.

Spurgeon stirred the throng, not fastidious or sensitive souls. He was
honest, robust, Puritan but not ascetic:--

    Crudeness may chill, and confidence offend,
    But manhood, mother-wit and selfless zeal,
    Speech clear as light and courage true as steel,
    Must win the many. Honest soul and brave,
    The greatest drop their garlands on your grave.

[Illustration: FICTION--PRESENT STYLE

GERTRUDE: "You never do anything now, Margaret, but go to all
sorts of Churches, and read those old Books of Theology. You never used
to be like that."

MARGARET: "How can I help it, Gerty? I'm writing a Popular
Novel!"]

At all points Spurgeon was poles apart from the "Adulated Clergyman,"
one of _Punch's_ "Modern Types" held up to contempt in the previous
year, and noted in another section--who develops out of a mincing
effeminate boy into an unconventional emotional preacher, ferocious
in pulpit denunciations, but full of honeyed sweetness in fashionable
drawing-rooms; adored by weak women, distrusted and despised by normal
men.

A new rival to the pulpit, it may be noted in conclusion, had sprung up
in the "theological romance." Mrs. Humphry Ward, whose _Robert Elsmere_
appeared in 1888, was its most widely read representative. But perhaps
her greatest title to our gratitude in this context is the fact that it
was her recommendation which induced Messrs. Macmillan to publish Mr.
Shorthouse's remarkable novel _John Inglesant_.




                       LONDON AND ITS GOVERNMENT

Growth and expansion rather than reconstruction was the leading
feature of London in the period with which we are now concerned. The
spreading of the "great wen," as Cobbett called it, went on in almost
all directions, and the linking up of the once detached village of
Kensington with Central London was followed by a remarkable extension
of that typically Victorian suburb. In 1884 _Punch_ described
travellers journeying for hours and hours in a northerly or westerly
direction, only to find that they had reached North Kensington or West
Kensington, as the case might be. Already in 1876 he had noted the
swallowing up of Brompton in South Kensington. Concurrently with this
suburban expansion the disappearance or removal of many old landmarks
went on apace. In 1876 _Punch_ had suggested that Temple Bar should be
removed by one of the elephants in the Lord Mayor's procession. The
long contemplated removal took place in 1878, and the historic site was
duly occupied by the pedestal bearing the much-criticized "Griffin,"
which led to abundant satirical comment in prose and verse and
pictures. The block in the traffic had been removed, but the cartoon of
"Alice in Blunderland" showed that from an architectural point of view
_Punch_ thought the remedy worse than the disease. Cremorne Gardens,
the scenes of alternate revelries in high and low life, were closed in
1877, and the withdrawal of "Evans's" licence in 1879 was plaintively
celebrated in the lament of a middle-aged Man about Town:--

    Farewell the quiet chop! the kidneys poached!
    Farewell the grizzled bones and the mixed drinks,
    That made abstention virtue--O, farewell!
    Farewell the ready waiter, the vague bill,
    The nose-enlivening pinch, eye-winking smoke,
    The kindly hand-shake, and all quality,
    Pride, pomp, and circumstance of Paddy Green!
    And O you ancient Basses, whose rude throats
    The immortal Jove's dread clamour counterfeit,
    Farewell!--A fellow's occupation's gone!

    --_Othello_ improved.

In January, 1883, the old colossal equestrian statue of the Duke of
Wellington at Hyde Park Corner was taken down, and on the night of
August 12, 1884, was "removed by Messrs. Pickford in a specially
constructed waggon drawn by ten horses to Aldershot." The old statue,
universally condemned and ridiculed, which would have been removed
immediately but for Wellington's own objection, had been allowed to
de-decorate a splendid site for nearly forty years. Boehm's statue,
which replaced it, dates from 1888. To turn from the grandiose to the
homely, we may note that _Punch_ vigorously espoused the cause of the
cow-keepers in St. James's Park in 1885, and under the heading, "Wild
Sports Near the Horse Guards," protested against the "chivvying from
their milk-stalls of a lot of poor old women." One does not look for
humour in the _Annual Register_, but the mention of this episode in
that useful book of reference blends information with entertainment:--

  _September 1st, 1885._ In pursuance of the orders of H.R.H. The
  Ranger, the stall-holders in St. James's Park, who represented the
  ancient "Milk Fair," held for nearly two centuries in the Mall, were
  ordered to close their booths and remove their cows. Two only of the
  stall-keepers refused to comply and after a strong protest in the
  newspapers, stating that some of the existing tenants had held stalls
  for more than a century [_sic_], the order for their immediate removal
  was relaxed and a compromise at length effected.

The respite granted to these interesting centenarians expired a few
years later, and now the St. James's Park menagerie contains nothing
larger than the pelicans.

[Sidenote: _Demolition and Innovation_]

The proposed demolition of Staple Inn in 1886 was peculiarly
distasteful to _Punch_, who held all these old buildings in pious
reverence, and inspired him to indite a ballad of remonstrance to
the builder. As a matter of fact, the protest was premature, for the
Prudential Assurance Company, into whose hands it passed by purchase,
maintained the building as a relic of vanishing London. No such regrets
as those awakened by the passing of Staple Inn were aroused by the
announcement in 1887 that the Old Bailey and Newgate Prison were to be
demolished. When the old Fleet prison was dismantled, _Punch_ could
indulge in legitimate rejoicing, because it marked the close of a harsh
and cruel penal system--imprisonment for debt. Here it was only a case
of structural and sanitary improvements. In ancient days there were
prisons impressive by their dignity of design. Their purpose inspired
the strange and sinister side of Piranesi's genius in his famous
imaginative series of "Carcere." But a modern gaol can at best be an
unobtrusive reminder of a still necessary evil.

Though no achievement comparable in size and importance to the
scheme of the Thames Embankment is associated with this period, new
architectural features were not wanting; foremost among them were
Street's new Law Courts, the swan-song in stone of the Gothic revival;
a group of buildings dignified in conception and treatment, but
terribly handicapped by their internal discomforts and darkness. I have
already spoken of the "Griffin." Cleopatra's Needle was at last set up
on the Embankment in 1878, and remains to this day a standing proof of
the doubtful wisdom of detaching ancient historic monuments from their
surroundings. There is something forlorn in this relic of Ptolemaic
Egypt, as it faces the winking sky signs of the Surrey side. To the
late 'seventies belongs another architectural innovation destitute
of beauty, and only remarkable for its size and height--Queen Anne's
Mansions. The invincible conservatism of the English could not be more
strikingly displayed than by the fact that after more than forty years
Queen Anne's Mansions remains our solitary skyscraper. The El Dorado
which this method of economizing space offers to landlords and builders
has never been exploited. Some put it down to our sense of the æsthetic
fitness of things; others to the paralysing effect of building laws,
vested interests, and the dead hand of "ancient lights." Sir Martin
Conway, as becomes one who has scaled high peaks in both hemispheres,
has recently come forward as an apostle of altitude in architecture,
but so far without much response. _Punch_ had no quarrel with anything
about Queen Anne's Mansions except their ugliness, and unreservedly
withdrew the charge of irregular financial procedure which he had
brought--on the strength of _The Times_--against the projector and
original proprietor, Mr. Hankey.

But Queen Anne's Mansions were interesting in another way, for they
marked the beginning of the system of residential flats, which has
since revolutionized London life. Though Queen Anne's Mansions remain
unique at the moment when I write, the flat system "came to stay," to
be extensively used, exploited, and criticized. "Flats" however, as we
understand the term, were devised for the convenience of the well-to-do
or middle-class people. Among the contributions to the solving of the
housing problem of the poor on the block system, the most notable
in this period was the benefaction of Lord Iveagh, who in 1889 set
aside £250,000 for the purpose, following the fine example set by the
American millionaire, Peabody. Charing Cross Road, opened in February,
1887, was one of the first of the new thoroughfares which have changed
the face of Central London. _Punch_ was much concerned in 1883 by a
report that tramways were about to invade Kensington; some years were
to elapse before they were admitted to the Embankment, but _Punch_
already complained in this year that it was being spoiled by railways
and roughs. Trafalgar Square continued to excite his unflattering
comments, but there is no public place in the world which lends
itself to more criticism. As an American writer once remarked, the
buildings seem to emphasize rather than to correct the slope, so that
everything seems to be slithering down towards Whitehall. A notable
addition was made to the Square in 1887 by the erection of the Gordon
Memorial, and _Punch_ records the curious fact that Thornycroft's
statue was unveiled, without any formality, by Mr. David Plunket, Chief
Commissioner of Works, in the presence of a few friends of the general.

[Sidenote: _National Opera Houses_]

The connexion of art with architecture was not very happy or impressive
in these years. When the Royal College of Music was founded in 1882
with Sir George Grove, _Punch's_ old friend, as Director, it was
temporarily and inadequately housed in the buildings of the National
Training School of Music, in which it had been merged. The move to the
new buildings in Prince Consort Road did not take place till 1894. The
annals of opera, so far as architecture is concerned, are positively
disastrous. Mapleson, the once famous operatic impresario, projected
a grand National Opera House on the Embankment; the first brick was
laid by Mlle. Titiens in September, 1875, and the first stone of the
building by the Duke of Edinburgh in December. But the patronage of
"stars" and Royal Dukes could not conjure money out of the pockets
of the investing public. The scheme languished, and in 1881 _Punch_
records that the unfinished Opera House was being converted, not
musically, into "flats." By the summer of 1884 the project collapsed
entirely, and _Punch's_ comments on "A Beggar's Opera House" are not
without their point to-day:--

  The sale by auction last week of what the retiring newspaper paragraph
  chronicling the melancholy fact described as the "materials of the
  unfinished Grand National Opera House on the Thames Embankment,"
  cannot but afford food even to the least artistic mind for some rather
  disagreeable reflections. That after a six years' struggle, involving
  the sinking of something like £100,000 in hard cash, the speculative
  element, that ought to have been equal to the emergency in the first
  capital in the world, should have been contented to look on and smile,
  while, to quote once more the paragraph in question, "157 lots, the
  principal portion of which consisted of the iron girders and columns
  used in the formation of the pit and box circles, originally costing,
  it is said, £40,000," were knocked down for "the small sum of £218" is
  something not very far removed from a national disgrace.

The building was finally demolished in 1888.

Another scheme which also ended disastrously, though the building
survives, was D'Oyly Carte's venture into the domain of serious opera.
The new English Opera House in Shaftesbury Avenue opened in 1891 with
Sullivan's _Ivanhoe_, but the analogy of the Gilbert and Sullivan light
operas was deceptive: the expectation of a long run was doomed to
failure, and the English Opera House was shortly afterwards converted
into the Palace Music Hall. _Punch's_ patriotic _amour propre_ was
wounded by the fact that where _Ivanhoe_ had failed, the _Basoche_,
its successor, and an essentially French opera, had caught on. Why,
he asks, call it the English Opera House? Why not the "Cosmopolitan"
or the "Royal Babel Opera House"? But these are questions which do
not fall within the scope of our immediate inquiry. It is enough to
record the fact that an abortive attempt to establish English opera on
a permanent basis succeeded in enriching the variety stage with a new
temple, while the site of Mapleson's projected Grand National Opera
House is now occupied by New Scotland Yard, generally admitted to be
the most successful outcome of the genius of Norman Shaw.

In earlier days _Punch_ had constituted himself an unofficial
Inspector of Nuisances for the Metropolis, and he never fulfilled
these self-imposed duties with greater zeal and even fury than in the
long campaign which he waged throughout the 'eighties against the
then Duke of Bedford. London was a "City of Dreadful Dirt" and Covent
Garden Market and the small streets around it, in _Punch's_ view, held
the palm for filthiness. He had given the Dukes a rest for a good
many years, but the scandal of "Mud-Salad Market" revived in him a
truculence worthy of Douglas Jerrold:--

DUKE OF MUDFORD: "Sweet pretty place, ain't it?"

MR. P. (_Inspector of Nuisances_): "No, my Lord Duke, it
isn't pretty, and it isn't sweet! Here, take this broom, and make a
clean sweep of it!"]

[Sidenote: _Mud-Salad Market_]

  Mud-Salad Market belongs to his Grace the Duke of Mudford. It was
  once a tranquil Convent Garden, belonging first to the Abbot of
  Westminster, and finally to the Dukes of Mudford. The property
  having been let on building leases, it became a small square in the
  centre of London, bounded on one side by Inigo Jones's church--"The
  handsomest barn in England"--on another side by a theatre, and warmly
  supported on other sides by numerous minor taverns. The hot-houses
  of the old Garden have become the pot-houses of the modern Market.
  Mud-Salad Market, like its own vegetables, has now sprouted out in
  all directions. You may start from Cabbage-leaf corner, near the site
  of Temple Bar, on a market-morning, and may go as far as Turnip-top
  Square in Bloomsbury, or Cauliflower-place at Charing Cross, and
  it is all Mud-Salad Market. Houses are barricaded with mountainous
  carts of green-stuff, cabs lose themselves in vain attempts to drive
  through the maze of vegetables, the costermonger makes temporary
  gardens on the pathway, while the roads are blocked with waggons,
  carts, donkey-trucks, and porters staggering under the weight of huge
  baskets. Carrots, turnips, vegetable-marrows, potatoes, lettuces, and
  onions are masters of the situation. Vegetable refuse, ankle deep,
  carpets the pathway in every direction, mixed with mud and rain-water,
  and trampled into a pulpy slimy muck by thousands of hob-nailed boots.
  Leases drop in, old houses are pulled down, great spaces are cleared,
  new houses of an approved stucco type are built, and no attempt is
  made to increase the legitimate limits of Mud-Salad Market.

        *       *       *       *       *

  It is not too much to say that Mud-Salad Market is a disgrace to
  London, a special disgrace to his Grace of Mudford, and about the
  greatest nuisance ever permitted in a great City of Nuisances.

  Rather different this account of Mud-Salad Market from Leigh Hunt's
  description of a certain Covent Garden Market in his day, when "it was
  the most agreeable in the metropolis," and when it had been "raised"
  into "a convenient and elegant state by the noble proprietor." Let his
  Grace of Mudford take a leaf from that Duke's tree, and, if he can't
  "raise" Mud-Salad Market, let him "raze" it, and give us a new one.

  Grant, your Grace, a new broom to some one, let a clean sweep be
  made of Mud-Salad Market, and your petitioners will never again pray
  anything any more.

That was written in August, 1880. A fortnight later _Punch_ renews and
enlarges his attack:--

                   THE DUKE OF MUDFORD IN GLOOMSBURY

  The Duke of Mudford's grip upon London extends far beyond Mud-Salad
  Market. As Lord Cul-de-Sac and the Earl of No Thoroughfare, he claims
  and exercises a right of blockade in Gloomsbury. London is a very
  peculiar city. It is said to be sixteen miles long and eight miles
  broad, and is supposed to contain a population of four millions.
  Its parochial rulers for the last ten years have devoted all their
  energy to the improvement of the great avenues of communication from
  East to West, but the cross avenues are in much the same condition
  as they were in the days of Dr. Johnson. The Strand and Fleet Street
  have been improved, Oxford Street, Holborn, Newgate Street, etc.,
  have been widened, a noble Embankment has been made, and a great
  serpentine roadway, extending from Waterloo Bridge to Whitechapel, is
  in course of formation. While this is done, or being done, there is
  not a thoroughfare worthy of the name from South to North, from Park
  Lane to Chancery Lane. Berkeley Street, Bond Street, St. Martin's
  Lane, and other cross streets have to get rid of their northern
  traffic by dodging round corners. The most central and most important
  thoroughfare from South to North, is composed of Waterloo Bridge (a
  bridge from which the halfpenny tax on suicide has just been removed),
  Wellington Street (which stands on a hill, and is adorned by the
  Thalia and Melpomene Theatres), Bow Street (which might be called
  Bow-legged Street, where criminals are tried), Endell Street (where
  they grow the criminals who are tried at Bow Street), and Gower
  Street, which belongs to the Duke of Mudford.

[Sidenote: _A Ducal Defaulter_]

  At the north end of Gower Street the traffic is stopped by a ducal
  barrier, and turned round several narrow streets, to find its way
  to the Euston Road as best it can. Three of the largest railway
  termini--the North Western, the Midland and the Great Northern lie in
  this direction; but the Duke of Mudford, Lord Cul-de-Sac, and Earl of
  No Thoroughfare claims his right to stand between these railways and
  their floods of traffic. The line must be drawn somewhere, and it is
  drawn at Gower Street. It was Mrs. Partington's mission to try to mop
  back the Atlantic: it is the Duke of Mudford's mission to push back
  four millions of people.

  By the way, Mud-Salad Market was at its dirtiest and filthiest last
  Thursday. Such a standing nuisance in London ought to be as impossible
  as it is impassable.

When the Duke of Westminster helped to start a cheap eating-house
with beds and baths in Bow Street, _Punch_ invidiously contrasted his
philanthropy with the recalcitrance of the Duke of "Mudford." Nor was
he content with agitating for the improvement of Covent Garden, but
followed up his attack by a similar exposure of the filthy condition
of Billingsgate, maintained by force of vested interests, where the
overcrowding led to the destruction of large quantities of fish and
the consequent enhancement of prices.[5] In 1883 the Duke of Bedford
had apparently been goaded into offering Covent Garden Market to
the Municipal Authorities, but they declined to relieve him of his
responsibilities, and the campaign continued. _Punch_ was not the only
paper which attacked the Duke for neglecting his London property, but
it was the most outspoken and persistent. The Duke had the reputation
of being an improving landlord on his country estates, but over a
million sterling had been added to the ducal revenues in his time by
fines exacted on leases falling due on his Bloomsbury estate, and, in
view of this fact, the scandal of Covent Garden inevitably exposed him
to hostile comment, from which his successors have been wholly immune.

[Footnote 5: An attempt was made in 1884 to open a new fish market in
Smithfield to break the monopoly of Billingsgate, but the scheme failed
through mismanagement, and _Punch_ renewed his attacks in 1889.]

Much of _Punch's_ criticism of the drawbacks of London was destructive.
But he did not refrain from specific suggestions. For example, he
persistently agitated for the painting of street names on lamps as a
guide at night, and to good purpose, as the extract overleaf shows. The
lighting of London still left much to be desired, and foreshadowed the
obligatory darkness of war time:--

  Punch has long been pegging away at the Vestries and District Boards,
  to turn the street lamps to account for display of the street names
  after dark. His pegging has profited. He is glad to hear that the
  practice is spreading, and will soon, he hopes and trusts, be
  general. Wherever it is neglected, let ratepayers take up the cry,
  and bombard not their street lamps, but their District Boards. The
  manufacturer who has supplied labels with street names for the
  lamps in Camberwell, writes to _Punch_ to say that he has furnished
  similar labels throughout the parishes of Kennington, St. George
  the Martyr Southwark, St. Mary's Newington, and Limehouse, as also
  to the boroughs of Leeds, Leicester, Birmingham, Bootle-cum-Linacre
  near Liverpool, and Newcastle-on-Tyne. He has also been supplying the
  Board of Works with lamp-tablets notifying the position of Fire-plugs
  and Hydrants, in the parishes of St. George the Martyr Rotherhithe,
  Deptford, Charlton, and Woolwich, and is now preparing to fix similar
  tablets in the parish of St. George the Martyr Hanover Square.

  "Light--more Light"--is _Punch's_ cry, as it was fighting Ajax's, and
  dying Goethe's. All honour to Sugg for his railway-Argand-burner, and
  his new naphthalene with its forty-candle power--and when next he fits
  it to a train, may _Punch_ be there to see, instead of to struggle
  with a tantalising twilight, as he does under the present mockery of
  railway-carriage illumination.

Another movement in which _Punch_ took an active part was that for
the provision of respectable restaurants for girl workers. The
"Coffee-Houses," which were then almost the only sort of cheap
eating-houses available, were both dirty and dismal, and the need
offered _Punch_ in 1881 an opportunity for combining a practical
suggestion with a dig at the Duke of Bedford:--

[Sidenote: _Punch's Suggested Improvements_]

                          A GOOD THING TO DO.

  If the Church and Stage Guild, and the Association for Administering
  Weak Tea to Reluctant Ballet Girls, are inclined for practical work,
  we can tell them how to make themselves exceedingly useful to the
  humbler members of the dramatic profession. Pantomime rehearsals are
  beginning, and hundreds of girls, many of them living far off in the
  suburbs, and most of them receiving only a few shillings a week, are
  brought into the neighbourhood of Covent Garden early, kept at work
  all day, with no time to return home before they are required for
  their night duty at the theatres. There are hundreds of taverns,
  public-houses, coffee-shops, restaurants, and pastry-cooks, in and
  about the Strand, but, as far as we are aware, and we are pretty well
  up in the supply resources of this neighbourhood, there is _not one
  place where these girls can go to get a cheap and decent meal_. They
  can go to hundreds of places, if they like to spend half their week's
  earnings in less than an hour, but they cannot even do this without
  being stared at like wild beasts, or annoyed by the insolent patronage
  of the cad and the prowler. Commercial philanthropy has given the
  market-men and women of Covent Garden a "kiosk" in Bow Street, and
  what is done for the Mudford gang might surely be done for Theatrical
  London. The old Bow Street Police Station is empty and wanting a
  tenant, as "To Let" bills are stuck upon its broken windows. It has
  space and position, and the least the Duke of Mudford--the proprietor
  of Covent Garden and Drury Lane Theatres--can do, is to offer it at a
  very moderate rental for this useful purpose. A chance for Mudford and
  popularity.
