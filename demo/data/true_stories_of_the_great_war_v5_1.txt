The battle finished (September 10, 1914) the pursuit of the conquered
army commenced and kept the whole world in suspense, with eyes fixed on
this headlong flight towards the north, which lasted till the end of
the month, and which was to be the prelude of the great battles of the
Yser.

The region round Verberie was definitely cleared of Germans and was
become once more French. The little town for some days presented an
extraordinary spectacle.

We entered the town after having received the formal assurance of the
5th Chasseurs, who went farther on, that all the country was in our
hands. Some divisional cyclists were seated at the roadside. We asked
them for news of the 22nd, and their reply wrung our hearts. They knew
nothing definite, but they had met a country cart full of our wounded
comrades, who had told them that the regiment had been cut up.

No one could tell us where the divisional area was to be found. The
division itself appeared to have been dismembered, lost and in part
destroyed. We thought that we were the only survivors of a disaster,
and, once the horses were in shelter in an empty abandoned farm
stuffing themselves with hay, we wandered sadly through the streets
destroyed by bombardment and by fire in search of such civilians as
might have remained behind during the invasion.

A little outside the town we at last found a farm where two of the
inhabitants had stayed on. The contrast between them was touching.
One was a paralysed old man unable to leave his fields, the other was
a young girl of fifteen, a frail little peasant, and rather ugly.
Her strange green eyes contrasted with an admirable head of auburn
hair, and she had heroically insisted on looking after her infirm
grandfather, though all the rest of the family had emigrated towards
the west. She had remained faithful to her duty in spite of the
bombardment, the battle at their very door and the ill-treatment of
the Bavarian soldiers who were billeted in the farm. Distressed, yet
joyous, she prepared a hasty meal and busied herself in quest of food,
for it was anything but easy to satiate eleven men dying of hunger when
the Germans, who lay hands on everything, had only just left.

She wrung the neck of an emaciated fowl which had escaped massacre,
and, by adding thereto some potatoes from the garden, she served us
a breakfast, washed down with white wine, which made us stammer with
joy, like children. One needs to have fasted for five days to have
felt the cutting pains of hunger and of thirst in all their horror, to
appreciate the happiness that one can experience in eating the wing
of a scraggy fowl and in drinking a glass of execrable wine tasting
like vinegar. She bustled about, and her pitying and motherly gestures
touched our hearts. While we ate she told us the most astonishing story
that ever was, a story acted, illustrated by gestures, which made the
scenes live with remarkable vividness.

She told us how, faithful to her oath, she was alone when the Bavarians
came knocking at her door, how she lived three days with them, a butt
for their innumerable coarsenesses, sometimes brutally treated when the
soldiers were sober, sometimes pursued by their gross assiduities when
they were drunk; how one night she had to fly half naked through the
rain, slipping out through the venthole of the cellar, to escape being
violated by a group of madmen, not daring to go to bed again, sleeping
fully dressed behind a small copse; how at last French chasseurs had
put the Bavarians to flight and had in their turn installed themselves
in the farm, and how among them she felt herself protected and
respected.

She attached herself to her new companions, whom she looked after like
a mother for three days. Then they went away, promising to return, and
she was left alone.

But the next day at dawn, uneasy at the row that came from the town,
she decided to go in search of news. She put on a shawl and slipped
through the brushwood and thickets as far as the first houses. She was
afraid of being seen, and made herself as small as possible, keeping
close to the walls, crossing gardens and ruined houses. The terrible
noise increased, and she went towards it. She wanted to see what was
going on, and a fine virile courage sustained her. The shells fell near
her; no matter, she had only a few more steps to go to turn the corner
of a street. She arrived on the _place_ as the battle was finishing.

Her fifteen chasseurs were there, fifteen corpses at the foot of the
barricade. One of them, who still lived, raised himself on seeing her,
and held out his arms towards her. Then, forgetting all danger, in a
magnificent outburst of feminine pity, she braved the rain of fire and
dashed to the centre of the _place_. She knelt by the young fellow,
enveloped him in her shawl to warm him and rocked him in her arms till
he closed his young eyes for ever, thankful for this feminine presence
which had made his last sufferings less bitter.

While she remained kneeling on the pavement wet with blood, a last big
calibre shell knocked over, almost at her feet, a big corner house,
which in its fall buried the German and French corpses in one horrible
heap. She fell in a faint on the stones, knocked over by the windage of
the shell, which had so nearly done for her.

During the latter part of her discourse she straightened her thin
figure to the full, her strange eyes sparkled, and she appeared to be
possessed by some strong and mysterious spirit which made us tremble.
She became big in her rustic simplicity--big, as the incarnation of
grief and of pity, and of the peasant in her gave place to a living
image of the war--an image singularly moving and singularly beautiful.


II--WITH THE WARRIORS FROM THE MARNE

From the next day Verberie became in some degree the rallying point
for all soldiers who had lost touch with their units. Elements of all
sorts of regiments, of all arms, of all races even, arrived on foot,
on horseback, on bicycles, in country carts. There were dragoons,
cuirassiers, chasseurs, artillerymen, Algerian Light Infantry and
English. Bernous, khaki uniform, blue capes, rubbed shoulders with
dolmans, black tunics and red trousers.

In this extraordinary crowd there were men from Morocco mounted on
Arab horses and wearing turbans; there were "Joyeux" who wore the
tarboosh, and ruddy English faces surmounted by flat caps. All the
uniforms were covered with dirt and slashed and torn. Many of the men
had bare feet, and some carried arms and some were without. It was the
hazard of the colossal battle of the Marne, where several millions of
men had been at grips, which had thrown them on this point. All were
animated by the same desire for information, and particularly of the
whereabouts of their respective regiments. From every direction flowed
in convoys, waggons, artillery ammunition waggons, stragglers from
every division and from every army corps. The mix-up and the confusion
were indescribable. One heard shouting, swearing, neighing of horses,
the horns of motor-cars, and the rumble of heavy waggons, which shook
the houses.

Faces drawn with fatigue were black with dust and mud and framed in
stubbly beards. Everyone was gesticulating, everyone was shouting and
a bright autumn sun, following upon the storm, threw into prominence
amongst the medley of clothing the luminous splashes of gaudy colours
and imparted an Oriental effect to the crowd.


III--STORY OF THE PRIEST--AND TWO CHASSEURS

Having eaten, washed and rested, I walked the streets, drinking the
morning air and taking deep breaths of the _joie de vivre_, of the
strength and vitality mingled with the air. I looked on every side to
see whether I could not find some acquaintance in the crowd, some stray
trooper from my regiment.

So it was that the hazard of my walk brought me to a scene which moved
me to tears and which rests graven so deeply on my memory that I can
see its smallest detail with my eyes shut. The Gothic porch of the
church, with its fine sculptures of the best period, was open, making
in the brightness of the morning a pit of shade, at the foot of which
some candles shone like stars. On the threshold of the porch, gaily
lighted by the morning sun, a priest, whose fine virile face I can
still recall, held in his hand the enamel pyx, and his surplice of lace
of a dazzling whiteness contrasted with the muddy boots and spurs. One
could guess that after having traversed some field of battle, consoling
the wounded and the dying, he had dismounted to officiate in the open
air under the morning sun.

Before him, on a humble country cart and lying on a bed of straw, were
stretched the rigid bodies, fixed in death, of two chasseurs who had
fallen nobly while defending the bridge over the river. All around,
kneeling in the mud of the porch, a semicircle of bare-headed soldiers,
overcome by gratitude and humility, were assembled to accomplish a
last duty and pay their last respects to the two comrades who were
lying before them and who were sleeping their last sleep in their
bloodstained uniforms, and assisted at the supreme office. The priest
finished the _De profundis_, and in a clear voice pronounced the sacred
words "_Revertitur in terram suam unde erat et spiritus redit ad Deum
qui dedit illum_." The officiant gave the holy-water sprinkler to the
priest, who sprinkled the bodies and murmured "_Requiescat in pace_."
"Amen," responded the kneeling crowd, and a great wave of religious
feeling passed over the kneeling men, the greater part of whom gave way
to overmastering emotion.

I can still see a big devil of an artilleryman, with his head between
his hands, shaken by convulsive sobs. Having given the absolution, the
priest raised the host sparkling in the sunlight for the last time and
pronounced the sacramental words. I moved off, deeply affected by the
grandeur of the scene.


IV--DEPRAVED SOLDIERS IN A DRAWING ROOM

By the 12th a good number of 22nd Dragoons and some officers of the
regiment had rejoined at Verberie. We formed from this débris an almost
complete squadron under the command of Captain de Salverte, who had
succeeded in getting through the lines by skirting the forest.

I again found my officer, M. Chatelin, whom I had last seen in the
little clearing near Gilocourt, surrounded by lurking enemies, and
whom I had hardly dared hope to see again alive; also M. de Thézy, my
comrade Clère and others.

We were all sorry to hear that Lieutenant Roy had fallen on the field
of battle with several others, and that Major Jouillié had been taken
prisoner. As for Captain de Tarragon, it was stated that he might
have escaped on foot with his orderly and that he might be somewhere
in the neighbourhood with a contingent of escaped men, but any precise
information was wanting.

The night before I had slept in the drawing-room of the château
belonging to M. de Maindreville, the mayor. Its appearance merits some
brief description, so that those who are still in doubt as to the
savagery of the Germans may learn to what degree of bestiality and
ignominy they are capable of attaining.

This fine drawing-room was a veritable dung heap. The curtains were
torn, the small billiard-table lay upside down in the middle of the
room, a litter of rotting food covered the floor, the furniture
was in matchwood, the chairs were broken, the easy-chairs had had
their stuffing torn out of them and the glass of the cabinets was
smashed. One could see that all small objects had been carried off
and all others methodically broken. On the first floor the sight
was heart-breaking. Fine linen, trimmed with lace, was soiled with
excrement; excrement was everywhere, in the bath, on the sheets, on
the floor. They had vomited on the beds and urinated against the
walls; broken bottles had shed seas of red wine on the costly carpets.
An unnamable liquid was running down the staircase, obscene designs
were traced in charcoal on the wall-papers and filthy inscriptions
ornamented the walls.

I have told enough to give an idea of the degrading traces left by a
contemptible enemy. I have exaggerated nothing; if anything, I have
understated the truth.

And this is the people that wants to be the arbiter of culture and of
civilisation! May it stand for ever shamed and reduced to its true
level, which is below that of the brute beast.


V--THE SEARCH FOR CAPTAIN DE TARRAGON

On the morning of the 12th, under the command of Captain de Salverte
we crossed the Oise by a bridge of boats, the stone bridge having
been destroyed by dynamite some days before. We went north to billet
at Estrée-Saint Denis, which was to be the definite rallying point of
the 22nd Dragoons. We were followed by several country carts, full
of dismounted troopers, saddles, lances, cloaks and odds and ends of
equipment.

Acting on very vague information, I set out on the 13th to look for
Captain de Tarragon. I was mounted on a prehistoric motor bicycle,
requisitioned from the village barber. I scoured the country seeking
information from everyone I met. I received the most contradictory
reports, made a thousand useless detours and was exasperated when
overtaken by night without having found any trace of him.

I followed the road leading to Baron and to Nanteuil-le-Haudoin, along
which but a few days before the corps of Landwehr, asked for by von
Kluck, had marched with the object of enveloping our army, and along
which it had just been precipitately hustled back. The sky was overcast
and the day was threatening. At each step dead horses with swelled
bellies threatened heaven with their stiff legs. A score of soldiers
were lying in convulsed attitudes, their eyes wide open, with grimacing
mouths twisted into a terrifying smile, and with hands clasping their
rifles. Involuntarily I trembled at finding myself alone at nightfall
in this deserted country, where no living being was to be seen, where
not a sound was to be heard except the cawing of thousands of crows and
the purr of my motor, which panted on the hills like an asthmatic old
man, causing me the liveliest anxiety.

Fifteen hundred mètres from Baron, after a last gasp, my machine
stopped for ever, and, as I was ignorant of its mechanics, I was
compelled to leave it where it was and continue my journey on foot
through the darkness.

The proprietor of the château of Baron put me up for the night. As at
Verberie, everything had been burnt, soiled and destroyed. Nothing
remained of the elegant furniture beyond a heap of shapeless objects.
Next morning with the aid of a captain on the staff who requisitioned
a trap for me, I got back to Verberie and found Captain de Tarragon
there. He had slept at the farm of La Bonne Aventure, quite near to
where I lay.

When he saw me, after the mortal anxieties through which he had lived,
believing his squadron lost and cut up, he was overcome by such a
feeling of gratitude and joy that I saw tears rise to his eyes while
he shook me vigourously by the hand. He had already sent forward my
name for mention in the order for the day with reference to the affair
at Gilocourt and the death of poor Dangel. I was recommended for the
military medal, and my heart swelled with pride and joy, while I was
carried back to Estrée-Saint-Denis, stretched out in a country cart
with a score of dismounted comrades.

A few days afterwards I was promoted corporal and proudly sported the
red flannel chevrons bought at a country grocer's shop.


VI--TALES OF THE DRAGOONS

Once the half-regiment was reconstituted after a fashion, though many
were missing (a detachment of fifty men without horses having returned
to the depot), we were attached to the 3rd Cavalry Division, which
happened to be in our neighbourhood, ours having left the area for some
unknown destination. Until the 1st of October our lot was bound up
with that of the 4th Cuirassiers, who marched with us.

On the 23rd of September, as supports for the artillery, we were
present at violent infantry actions between Nesle and Billancourt. The
4th Corps attacked, and the furious struggle extended over the whole
country. My troop was detached as flank guard and, in the thick morning
fog, we knocked up against a handful of German cavalry, whom, in the
distance, we had taken for our own men.

We charged them at a gallop, and we noticed that they were tiring and
that we were gaining on them. One of them drew his sabre and cut his
horse's flanks with it, whilst a non-commissioned officer turned and
fired his revolver without hitting us; but, thanks to the fog, they got
away. We did not tempt providence by following them too far for fear of
bringing up in their lines.

At night we were sent to reconnoitre some fires which were reddening
the horizon and which, from a distance, seemed vast conflagrations. We
came upon a bivouac of Algerian troops, who were squatting on their
heels, warming themselves, singing strange African melodies and giving
to this corner of French soil an appearance of Algeria.

On hearing the sound of our horses they sprang to arms with guttural
cries, but when they had recognised that we were French they insisted
on embracing our officer and danced round us like children.

We billeted at Parvillers in a half-destroyed farm, and there at
daybreak a sight that suggested an hallucination met our eyes. Some ten
German soldiers were there in the courtyard dead, mowed down by the
"75," but in such natural attitudes that but for their waxen colour
one could have believed them alive. One was standing holding on to a
bush, his hand grasping the branches. His face bespoke his terror, his
mute mouth seemed as if in the act of yelling and his eyes were dilated
with fear. A fragment of shell had pierced his chest. Another was on
his knees, propped against a wall, under cover of which he had sought
shelter from the murderous fire. I approached to see where his wound
was and it took me a moment to discover it, so intact was the corpse.
I saw at last that he had had the whole of the inside of his cranium
carried away and hollowed out, as if by some surgical instrument. His
tongue and his eyes were kept in place by a filament of flesh, and his
spiked helmet had rolled off by his side. An officer was seated on some
hay, with his legs apart and his head thrown back, looking at the farm.

All these eyes fixed us with a terrifying immobility, with a look of
such acute terror that our men turned away, as if afraid of sharing it;
and not one of them dared to touch the magnificent new equipment of
the Germans, which would have tempted them in any other circumstances.
There were aluminum water-bottles and mess tins, helmet plates of
shining copper and sculptured regimental badges dear to the hearts of
soldiers, and which they have the habit of collecting as trophies.


VII--LAST CHARGE OF THE HORSEMEN

The dawn of the 25th broke without a cloud over the village of Folies.
A heat haze hid the early morning sun. The enemy were quite near, and
the sentries on the barricades gave the alarm. The cuirassiers and
dragoons, leaving their horses under cover, had been on watch in the
surrounding country since the morning to protect the village and the
batteries of "75's," which were firing from a little way back.

A non-commissioned officer and I had remained mounted. M. de Thézy
sent us to investigate some horsemen whose shadows had loomed through
the mist and whom we had seen dismount in an apple orchard near the
village of Chocques. We set off at a quiet trot, convinced that we had
to deal with some French hussars whom I had seen go that way an hour
before. We crossed a field of beetroot and made straight towards them.
They seemed anchored to the spot, and when we were within one hundred
mètres, and they showed no signs of moving, our confidence increased.
The fog seemed to grow thicker and our horses, now at the walk, scented
no danger. We were within fifty mètres of them when a voice spoke
out and the word "carbine" reached us distinctly, carried by a light
breeze. The non-commissioned officer turned to me, his suspicions
completely stilled, and said, "We can go on, they are French, I heard
the word carbine." At the same instant I saw the group come to the
shoulder and a dozen jets of fire tore the mist with short red flashes.
A hail of bullets fell all around us, and we had only just time enough
to put between them and ourselves as much fog as would conceal us, for
before turning tail we had seen the confused grey mass of a column
coming out of the village. We had only to warn the artillery and then
there would be some fun.

The lieutenant of artillery was two kilomètres back perched on a
ladder. Having listened to what we had to say, he turned towards his
gun and cried through a megaphone, "2600, corrector 18." We were
already far off, returning at the gallop to try to see the effect, and
it was a fine sight.

Leaving the horses in a farm, we slipped from tree to tree. There was
the column, still advancing. A first shell, ten mètres in front of it,
stopped it short; immediately a second fell on the left, wounding some
men, and a horse reared and upset its rider. A third shell struck
mercilessly into the centre of the column and caused an explosion
which sent flying, right and left, dark shapes which we guessed to
be fragments of bodies. It rained shell, which struck the road with
mathematical precision, sowing death and panic. In the twinkling of an
eye the road was swept clean. The survivors bolted in every direction
like madmen, and the agonising groans of a dying horse echoed through
the whole countryside.

       *       *       *       *       *

On the 1st of October we rejoined our division and the first
half-regiment at Tilloy-les-Mofflaines. Up to the 20th we passed
through a period of great privation and fatigue owing to the early
frosts. We were unable to sleep for as many as five days on end, and
when at night we had a few hours in which to rest, we passed them lying
on the pavement of the street, propped up against some heap of coal
or of stones, holding our horses' reins, each huddled up against his
neighbour to try and keep warm.


VIII--DIARY OF A FRENCH TROOPER

Here are extracts from my diary, starting from 8th of October:

_8th October._--All night we guarded the bridge at Estaires, after
having constructed a formidable barricade. Damp and chilly night,
which I got through lying on the pavement before the bridge; drank a
half-litre of spirits in little sips to sustain me. This is the most
trying night we have passed, but the spirits of all are wonderful.

_9th October_: _Twenty minutes to four, two kilomètres from Estaires,
scouting amongst beetroot fields._--Has the supreme moment come?
A little while ago I firmly believed it had; now I am out of my
reckoning, so incomprehensible and widespread is the struggle which
surrounds us.

We have evacuated Estaires and the bridge over the Lys, which we were
guarding, to rejoin our horses on foot. After some minutes on the road
the first shells burst. My troop received orders to fight dismounted,
and here we are, lying down as skirmishers amongst the beetroot, in
the midst of a heavy artillery and musketry fire. I am on the extreme
right, and a moment ago two shrapnel shells came over and burst six or
eight mètres above my head, peppering the ground with bullets. Never,
I imagine, have I come so near to being hit.

For the moment it is impossible to understand what is going on; the
whole of the cavalry which was on in front of us--chasseurs, dragoons
and all the cyclists--have fallen back, passing along the road on our
flank. We, however, have had no order to retire. The peasants with
their wives and children are running about the country like mad people.
It is a sorry sight. A moment ago I saw an old man and a little girl
fall in their hurry to escape from their farm, which a shell had just
knocked to pieces. They are like herds of animals maddened by a storm.

At dusk the Germans are 500 mètres off. We have orders to take up our
post in the cemetery of Estaires. I have hurt my foot and each step in
the ploughed land is a torture. I have noted a way which will lead me
to the bridge on the other side of the town.

I brought up my patrol at the double. When I got back I saw the troop
retiring.

We passed through the town, which had a sinister look by night,
reddened by the flames from many fires. The whole population is in
flight, leaving houses open to the streets, and crowding up the roads.
All the windowpanes are broken by the bombardment; somewhere, in the
middle of the town, a building is burning and the flames mount to the
sky. There are barricades in every street. We have reached the horses,
which are two kilomètres from the town, and we grope for them in the
dark. Mine is slightly wounded in the foreleg. Long retreat during the
night (the second during which we have not slept--a storm wets us to
the skin).

Arrived at Chosques at five in the morning. We get to bed at 6.30 and
we are off again at 8 o'clock. I ask myself for how many days men and
horses can hold out.

_10th October._--In the afternoon we again covered the twenty
kilomètres which separated us from Estaires. Hardly had we settled down
to guard the same bridge as yesterday when we were sent to La Gorgue.
On the way stopped in the village, as shells commenced to fall. The 1st
troop took refuge in a grocer's, where we were parked like sheep. A
large calibre shell burst just opposite with a terrible row. I thought
that the house was going to fall in. Lieutenant Niel, who had stayed
outside, was knocked over into the ditch and wounded. We are falling
back with the horses to La Gorgue, and we are passing a third night,
without sleep, on the road, Magrin and I on a heap of coal. Horses and
men have had nothing to eat, the latter are benumbed, exhausted, but
gay as ever.

_11th October._--We get to a neighbouring farm at Estrem to feed the
horses. They have scarcely touched their hay and oats before an order
comes telling us to rejoin at the very place from which we have come.
The Germans are trying to take the village from the east, thanks to
the bridge which they captured the day before yesterday, but we have
been reinforced by cyclists, and the 4th Division is coming up. We are
holding on; the position is good. The belfry of the town hall has just
fallen. We are going back to Estrem.

Three hours passed in a trench without greatcoats. Magrin and I are
so cold that we huddle up one against the other and share a woollen
handkerchief to cover our faces. We put up at Calonne-sur-la-Lys. And
so it goes on up to the 17th, the date on which we re-enter Belgium,
passing by Bailleul, Outersteene and Locre. It is not again a triumphal
entry on a fine August morning, it is a march past ruins and over
rubbish heaps.

At Outersteene, however, we were received with touching manifestations
of confidence and enthusiasm; an old tottering and broken-down teacher
had drawn up before the school a score of young lads of seven to ten
years old, who watched us passing and sang the _Marseillaise_ with all
their lungs, while the old man beat the time.

The village had been evacuated only three days ago, and it was from the
thresholds of its houses, partly fallen in and still smoking, that this
song rose, a sincere and spontaneous outburst.

Gilocourt"; "The Escape in the Forest of Compiegne"; "The Two Glorious
Days at Staden"; "The Funeral of Lord Roberts"; "The Attack at Loos.")

"TO RUHLEBEN--AND BACK"--LIFE IN A GERMAN PRISON

_Where the British Civilian Prisoners Are Held in Detention Camp_

_Told by Geoffrey Pyke, an English Prisoner_

  This is a picturesque and thrilling story of a real adventure.
  The author, a young Englishman, entered Germany at the outbreak
  of the War, was discovered, imprisoned, and transferred to the
  great detention camp at Ruhleben. Here he made one of the most
  marvelous escapes on record, and after undreamed-of dangers and
  hardships arrived in safety at the Dutch front. Mr. Pyke in
  relating his experience says: "I was caught up in a vast mechanism
  ... that bounds the German Empire and tossed from one part to
  another, was beaten, crushed, and hammered ... the machine took
  me and threw me in jail, and then in another jail, and then in
  another, and then back into the first. Finally vomiting me, in a
  fit of either weariness, mercy or disgust, into a concentration
  camp for untrained civilians." Finally escaping from Ruhleben on
  July 9th, 1915. "Had only the 4,500 other inhabitants of Ruhleben
  escaped at the same time, in a species of general stampede, and
  one or two other people in Berlin or elsewhere died or been called
  off, matters might have arranged themselves very satisfactorily."
  The escaped prisoner has collected his experiences into a volume
  entitled: "To Ruhleben--And Back," from which we present a single
  chapter by permission of his publishers, _Houghton, Mifflin and
  Company_.

[2] I--HERR DIREKTOR OF THE PRISON

I forget now how many times I saw the Direktor of the prison, though
at the time, the days on which I did were as distinct to me as wounds,
which a man cannot see, but which he knows individually and intimately.
In order to obtain audience of this gentleman, it was necessary, when
the warder unlocked the door at 6.30 and the pitchers were put out,
to ask to see the Herr Direktor. At half-past nine you were taken
out of the cell, let through the door at the end down one flight and
through to the floor which you could see over the railings of the
balcony. Here again you were put into a cell, and the door was locked,
and time passed by. Nothing else happened. In half an hour, or an
hour, you were lined up in the passage with any others who also had
requests. One by one you would go into that little office. You would
bow at the entrance. "Ja?" would remark the bald-headed old gray-beard,
with an Iron Cross of '70 hanging from his coat. "Ja?" And you would
state your request. A vast ledger opposite him, the old bird, for he
looked exactly like the Jackdaw of Rheims, would enter and sign and
countersign in it. His decision was given in a curt "_Ja_" or "_Nein_,"
or "_Das geht nicht_,"[3] and you would be standing in the line
outside, among those whose chance had not yet come. You had succeeded;
you had failed--who knows what luck would attend you on these
expeditions. Every request to write a letter had to be made in this
manner. The shiny-headed old bird, with the head jailer in attendance
his hand stiffly at his sword, would enter your name, the name of the
addressee, and the reason for writing it, in his vast ledger. "_Ja?
Nein. Das geht nicht_," and it is all over. Time after time I craved
permission to write to His Excellency the American Ambassador, to
request him to tell my people at home that I was alive. It was granted
at the third request. What agony were those mornings, pacing up and
down in the cell downstairs, waiting to be put into line. What could I
say to the old boy to persuade him? Hundreds of passionate words rose
in my mind, as I paced up and down that cell, waiting for the moment.
"_Bitte, Herr Direktor, kann ich ein brief schreiben?_"[4] was all that
I could stammer out, almost before I had reached the threshold of his
office. "_Ja? Nein. Das geht nicht_," and I, after staring at him with
eyes like a rabbit's fastened on a snake, unable to find words to say
more, aching with the dull misery of refusal, have passed away, giving
place to someone else who, in his turn, also succeeds or fails.

I used to try once a fortnight, and though I have since discovered that
even the letters I wrote were never sent, yet nevertheless I always had
a hope of their getting through. Regularly as clockwork every other
Monday, after the Hell of Sunday, I would request to see the Direktor.
For the first ten weeks, I persevered in this. Then suddenly I began to
go to pieces. I missed one Monday, and put off asking the old bald-pate
until Tuesday. When the moment came round on the Tuesday morning,
I funked again. Wednesday came, and again I funked. On Thursday, I
managed to push the words asking to see the Direktor from between my
lips. Then with a rush, realising there was no going back, I felt all
courage return to me. My head became as clear as a bell, and arguments
to meet every objection of the Direktor's came to my mind. He had
let me write several times previously, and I had not troubled him
now for seventeen days. I was confident. Again I repeated my request
gently to myself.... Suddenly I realised I was standing before him,
and that I must speak. I must say something. I had come there to say
something. Unless I asked him something, he would say I was not to be
brought before him again. My eyes fixed on the large pimple on the
top of his head. I could not take them away. The pimple was not quite
in the centre of the cranium, but occupied, so to speak, the position
halfway betwixt centre-forward and right outside. He wore it where a
comedian wears a top hat the size of a five-shilling bit in attempts
to be funny. My thoughts followed it. It was unique, and magnificent.
"Have YOU any superfluous hair?" I thought. I should love to breathe
very gently on the shiny surface, just to see if it becomes misty, or
whether it still shines through everything. I wondered if it was very
sensitive, so sensitive that he could feel what was reflected in it,
or whether it was pachydermatous, and safe to dig pins into. He was
going to move. He was just finishing off the entry he was making in the
ledger. He was going to look up at me and say, "Ja wohl?"--Speak, say
something--speak--speak....

It was evening. I was in my cell. The light was fading fast. I was
thinking how on the morrow I would try again, how it only needed
careful preparation, and I should be as able as anybody to say what I
wanted to,--to speak.


II--SOLITARY CONFINEMENT AT THE POLIZEIGEFANGNIS

After you have been in solitary for some time, it becomes increasing
difficult to retain your judgment. I know that first I would make up my
mind that I was going to be in prison for two years, and then a great
and irresistible hope would arise within me, that I should be sent to
a concentration camp called Ruhleben, that I had had a whisper of from
my friends. I had hoped for some sort of a trial to know how long I was
going to remain where I was. Every day that passed at ten o'clock,
when I imagined that anyone, before whom I might be brought, had come
down to his office, I would put on the one collar I had. Every day at
six I would take it off again, preserving it for the next day. At times
I became convinced that, because I was not yet of age, I was to be kept
for a few months more, and that the day after my twenty-first birthday,
I was to be sentenced to some ghastly sort of punishment, like solitary
for two years, or for life. (There seemed absolutely no difference
between these two, and I dreaded the one as much as the other. Both
appeared interminable, and I had no hopes of coming out sane, even
after the shorter period. I pictured myself moaning about the London
Law Courts in a celluloid collar, picking up a little copying work
here, and a little there, until I finally sank into a mumbling old age
at twenty-five, and died in delirium tremens at thirty.)

Another fact made me terribly despondent, and, fight how I would, was
gradually making me utterly hopeless. About fourteen days after my
companions of the British Relief Committee had gone, a new-comer had
arrived. He spoke German absolutely perfectly, but with an Austrian
accent. I had heard him say something to the warder. I will not tell
his story, for he is at the present moment in another prison in Berlin,
though not in solitary, and is, I know, writing his reminiscences
in readiness for when the war shall come to an end. Let it suffice,
however, to say that he had been discovered, soon after war broke out,
writing articles for a London paper. He was arrested at the flat he
happened to be living in, and, after a large amount of palaver, was
given twenty-four hours to leave the country in. He was accompanied
to the frontier. Within a fortnight he was back again. He had gone
to London, had seen his paper, had come back to Holland, and at the
frontier had pretended to be an Austrian waiter who had been expelled
from England. He so exasperated his interrogators at the frontier
by his eternal repetition of his ill treatment at the hands of his
dastardly English employers, that they finally let him pass. However,
in the end he was caught--as we all are--and recognised. He had been
told that he was to be sent to this place Ruhleben, and, when one day
he disappeared, I naturally surmised that he had been taken there.
He was very good to me, for he had managed to get permission to buy
fruit; I had been refused it. So he used to buy double the quantity,
and daily, on going down the stairs, smuggle me an apple. "If he," I
argued, "who has done this thing _twice_, and who is hoary with old
age (he was about thirty-five), gets sent to this camp Ruhleben, after
being here for three weeks, and I, who have only done it once, and am
not yet of age, and have been here nine weeks, and have not been sent
there, then there is no hope of my ever getting there. They would have
sent me there by now, were they going to do so at all." Afterwards, I
found, of course, that he had never been sent anywhere near Ruhleben,
but simply to another prison. I heard the most wonderful stories about
his doings there, from a friend who was sent to prison for a time. He
would appear for exercise dressed in flamboyant pink running shorts, a
vest and socks to match--and a top hat. What on earth for? Well, if the
walls of prison don't supply you with humour or whimsicality, you must
undertake the task yourself.

The best of luck to him. He probably thinks I am still in that
Polizeigefängnis.

For some time I had been the oldest inhabitant of the prison. The usual
denizen of the place came for a day or two, and then went on his way
through that process called Law and Justice. My position gradually
came to give me tiny privileges. For instance, they became quite
convinced that I was going mad, for, apart from my habit of walking
round and round the exercise yard at nearly five miles per hour, every
night I would repeat the Jabberwocky. It had taken me a whole week
with my broken-down memory to piece together the odd bits of lines and
verses that I still carried in my head; and another week to evolve Mr.
Kipling's "If." I would suddenly shout loudly into the solid blackness
that "All mimsey were the borrow-groves and the moamwraths outgrabe,"
I knew quite well that borrogoves was the correct litany, but I
preferred borrow-groves; so borrow-groves it was. "One two, one two
and through and through the vorpel blade went snicker snack. He left
it dead and with its head he went galumphing back," and I would make
that "snicker snack" all slow and creepy, like Captain Hook; and would
rise to a triumphant roar as I announced the fact that he "galumphed"
back, in preference to any other form of locomotion that might have
been available, glorying at his ability to resist temptations such
as taxi-cabbing, taking the tube, or walking, and, above all, the
insidious run.

  "_If_ you can make one heap of all your winnings,
    And risk it on one turn of pitch and toss,
  And lose; and start again at your beginnings,
    And never breathe a word about your loss."

_If_ (and I shouted as if I was praying for life itself)

  "_If_ you can force your heart, and nerve, and sinew
    To serve their turn, long after they are gone,
  And so hold on, when there is nothing in you,
    Except the will, which says to them, 'hold on.'"

And I would repeat it softly to myself, until loudly again, pacing
madly up and down the cell, I would argue, "Yes, that's all very well,
you know, but your will is the very thing that suffers before your
heart and nerve and sinew are anywhere near gone. Why, it's the very
base, the very foundation of all things, that it attacked, and then
what are you going to do, Mr. Rudyard?" Nevertheless, I found an odd
sort of comfort, and they were nearly always my prayer to the setting
sun as the darkness stole in.

I also used to hum, whistle, and sing. This was strictly forbidden by
one of the thirty-three regulations pasted on the back of the door. One
night in December, when the darkness had been extra oppressive,--I was
in darkness for eighteen out of the twenty-four hours--and I had been
singing loud enough for the warders to hear, one came up and, rapping
on the door, said that such behaviour was forbidden, nevertheless,
he would ask the Herr Direktor as an especial favour, if I might be
permitted to whistle occasionally. This is what comes of being the
oldest inhabitant of a jail. The next day there was solemnly filled
into the ledger by the chief warder, and countersigned by the Direktor,
"Erlaubnis zu nummer acht und fünfzig zu singen und zu pfeifen."[5]


III--IN A CELL AT THE STADT VOGTEI

I shall never forget the day on which, after thirteen weeks, in
January, 1915, I left prison--to go to another. Nothing, I was
convinced, could be more of a living Hell than those thirteen weeks at
the Polizeigefängnis. I was escorted out into the street. There was
snow upon the pavements: it had been summer when I saw them last. Our
route lay round the corner. Here, after passing through a low door in
an immensely thick wall, once again I found myself in an atmosphere,
not merely of red tape, but of the very essence from which tape,
and redness, are made. Those innumerable bureaux: those ticketings,
docketings, searching of clothes, etc., occupied a couple of hours,
until I found myself in a bright and beautiful cell thirteen feet by
six. This was the famous Stadt Vogtei prison. "Vogtei," literally
translated, means a bailiff's office, but why a prison should be called
"The City Bailiff's Office," or why the city bailiff's office should be
a prison, I am at a loss to say.

Notwithstanding the bailiff, it was quite a good prison. Large numbers
of English people--five to six hundred in all--had been here before
they were sent to Ruhleben "for purposes of quarantine" as the official
report says. It was a gentleman's prison; it was intended for those who
had sentences for minor offences to serve, e.g. two to three months.
But this did not frighten me, as I knew of its character as a depot
for Ruhleben. I was full of hope. We had two meals of skilly a day
instead of one. I was allowed to talk to the others during the two
hours' exercise they were good enough to allow, and I could buy almost
anything I wanted--bar newspapers.

I had another experience here that nearly killed me. There was the
usual shelf for bowl, spoon, etc., and from the side hung a fat little
book with one hundred and thirty-three rules. It contained all the
punishments for all the various main crimes, worked out in permutations
and combinations. Things such as "for not cleaning out of the cell
for the first time the prisoner is to be punished by the three days'
withdrawal of the midday hot meal, or instead one day withdrawal of the
hot meal, and a second day withdrawal of the cold meal (breakfast), or,
in lieu thereof.... In addition to which ... or as an alternative ...
in substitute thereof.... But for the second offence, or dirtiness of
a second degree, or unpunctuality of the third degree, or noise of the
twentieth degree, the prisoner shall be punished by withdrawal of ...
whereof ... in lieu of this can be subtituted ..." etc. etc.

On the outside of this little fat book with its one hundred and
thirty-three rules was a diagram of the shelf from which it hung,
showing exactly in what order the washing bowl, the eating bowl, the
spoon, the fork, the soap were to be placed. And not merely was there a
front view, but also two side views were given: one showing the side of
the shelf with one towel hanging somnolently from a nail, and the other
side view showing the other end of the shelf with the booklet itself
hanging even more somnolently from another nail. But yes, there was
something more: for not merely was there a picture of the booklet, but
the picture of the booklet had the picture of the booklet pasted on the
booklet's cover, and, what is more, the side which bore this diagram
faced outwards, and the right-hand top corner was against the wall.
Thus was it according to the picture. But it so happened that this was
impossible, for the two were incompatible. Either the picture had to
face inwards, or the left-hand top corner must touch the wall. But both
together was contrary to the nature of the book. Feeling rather jolly
at my new environment, I pointed this out to the jailer, who wasn't a
bad sort of fellow, when he came in. At first he didn't grasp it, but
when he did, he took serious note of it with pen and ink. Next day,
in came the prison governor, a military-looking fellow, and he went
straight to the booklet at the side of the cupboard, and examining the
diagram on the cover, studied the incompatibility carefully for a long
time. He turned round, and after looking whimsically at me, and then at
the warder for some time, as if trying to make up his mind as to who
was the biggest fool, said, "H'm," very definitely, and went away.

Alas, I only remained here five days. I had hardly finished breakfast
when the warder came round with a list and said I was to "pack
up," though, since I had nothing to pack, his orders were rather
superfluous. Again weary hours of waiting in the bureau, and then, for
the first time in my life, I saw the inside of Black Maria.

I had imagined it to have cells all the way down the side, but
there were only two. There were seven of us, including a woman and
a policeman. Heaven knows what the woman was "in" for, and though I
several times formulated the question mentally, I could never manage
to get it out. The policeman was quite a nice fellow, and let us talk,
and joined in himself with an air of a busy man sparing a moment to
play with some children. It soon became plain that one of the men was
the woman's husband, or ought to have been if he wasn't. The others
were gentlemen, sentenced for petty offences, who were being taken to
the town hall to be enlisted in the army. They did not seem to relish
the prospect, but "at any rate," they said, "it would be a change." I
looked through the grille to see what I could of Berlin streets. There
were not many people on them, and the greater number were women and
in black, but the quietness of the place was nothing to what I was
to see later. There were a few luxury-selling shops, such as flower
sellers, that were closed, but the majority seemed able to get along.
That Teutonic spectacle, extraordinary but obviously sensible, of
women going about without hats could be seen everywhere. And then we
suddenly drove into the inevitable yard. Two gates unbarred and locked
themselves automatically as one passed.


IV--"MY THIRD PRISON--MOABIT: CELL 1603"

It was the great prison--Moabit. A huge central hall surmounted by a
dome, with wings going in all directions and the end of each wing
connected by another great building, each with six storeys of cells,
and each of these with its iron balcony with glass flooring. There
was noise, and clanging of doors everywhere. I was told to stand at
the commencement of one of the wings, just off the dome. There was a
huge clock, and I noticed it had a bell attached to it. At any rate,
I thought, I shall hear the hour strike. The number of my cell, I
can remember it now, was 1603, "the year Queen Elizabeth died," I
remarked to myself, as it was unlocked, and I went in. It was a larger
cell than I had hitherto had--about fourteen feet by six. There was
electric light and a table and seat that folded down from the wall.
The window was, as usual, above my head, but this time it was made of
frosted glass. There was a horrid suggestion of permanency about the
place that made me feel rather bad. I asked the warder who gave me
my prison underclothing--I was allowed to keep my own suit--whether
one was always in solitary here, and for how long one came. "Immer
im einzelhaft"--always in solitary,--and for three to four months
and upward, he said. "Never less?" I asked. "No, never," he replied.
"Come with me," he continued, and I was taken down into the very
bowels of this terrible edifice, till, finally, I joined a vast squad
of criminals. He left me. We then filed down devious passages once
more, and finally were led into a vast room with about two hundred
and seventy showers in it. When bathed, I was locked into a large,
bare cellar just opposite, and here I was soon joined by two others,
one an elderly middle-aged man of about fifty-six, and the other an
evil-looking devil of about thirty-four. They sat down on the bench.
I was walking up and down. They were an interesting couple. They
were about to be examined by an Untersuchungsrichter, or examining
magistrate, and the younger one was coaching the other in what to say.
The elder seemed too numbed to agree or disagree, though he seemed to
have a tendency towards the truth, which the other promptly suppressed,
but just sat there, his hands on his knees, seemingly deaf. Once the
younger strode up to him threateningly as if to hit him. He ground his
teeth and swore that by God, if the old man were to say that he'd ----.
Then he tried a different tack; he argued, he elucidated, he showed the
simplicity of his ideas, and how, above all, it would help themselves.

When the young one became bellicose I had felt no inclination to help
the old man. Why, I knew not. I think I felt that nothing, least of all
truth, should stand in the way of man's salvation from that place, and
that if the old man hadn't got enough gumption to tell what seemed to
be a few well-concocted lies, well, he ought to be made to, since it
involved the fate of the younger man, who was not yet reduced to the
state of an incapacitated jelly. It was the same old story: Fate had
beaten the old man, but had not succeeded in persuading the young one
that he also was beaten; the young one refused to acknowledge it. It
was blind instinct that told him to lie, though he knew with clever
lawyers against him, and, worst of all opponents, the law, the chances
of his getting through to freedom were remote. I had noticed hitherto
that it was always the young men who felt the strain most, seemed most
conscious of the inhuman cruelty of prison, and I was to find out later
that it was generally the young ones who recovered easiest. Sometimes
the older ones don't recover. A man I was to meet later was afflicted
with sudden decay of the optic nerve, and is now gradually going blind,
purely as a result of solitary.

The door opened suddenly, and they were taken out, and as they passed
me I saw the younger and villainous one look at the old man, in a
manner in which threats, prayers, and above all, the desire to instil
the wish to live were all inexpressibly mixed. They passed. I never saw
them again. I often wonder where they are. There are lots like them.

I was taken back to my cell. I was now sinking fast. I saw little hopes
of recovery. I was quickly becoming a broken-down creature, and though
physically I should have lasted out for years, mentally I saw there was
a crash not far ahead. I had seen it happen with other men before. As
it was, mentally I was fast becoming a species of cow. I would stand
for hours at a time, leaning my head into the corner, my hands in my
pockets, staring at the floor. I would find that for hours I had been
saying to myself "My dear sir"--I always called myself "my dear sir"
when talking out loud,--"you really must make an effort to get out. I
mean it's simply too stupid to spend the best years of your life in a
box like this. Use your wits. Do something. Go on, you juggins, get
out somewhere. Think!" and so on, from twelve till three. I became
absolutely impersonal, and found it difficult to have likes and
dislikes about anything. I absolutely forgot what flowers smelt like.
Milk I could not imagine. Fruit, tobacco, fish, were mere names to me.
I had forgotten what they were. I could not understand the meaning of
the term "red."

Though I longed to be free, I felt that human beings would be perfectly
unbearable. I no longer considered myself as one. I felt perfectly
decorporealised: I was merely a mind contemplative and a poor one at
that. And yet I longed for their company. I still kept up my nightly
habit of repeating a few verses from any poem I could remember, and
after the light had gone out--for here there was electric light--I
would rise solemnly in the dark, and make the most fiery speeches to
the Cambridge Union--poor Cambridge Union. I would then proceed to
oppose my own motion, pick holes in it, show up the proposer as an
impostor and a charlatan. A seconder would then arise, who with all
the sarcasm of a Voltaire would rend the immediate speaker adjective
from substantive, verb from adverb, until quivering with the laceration
received, the latter would be thrown, a bleeding proposition, into the
waste deserts of verbosity.


V--GHASTLY HOURS UNDER GERMAN BRUTALITY

It was just about this time that I nearly got myself shot for attempted
murder. I was so used to the darkness that I found electric light
rather trying to the eyes, and therefore turned the racket upwards
toward the ceiling in order to have but reflected light. A little
later in came the warder. He saw the upturned bracket, and lifting
the hilt of his sword, hit me sharply over the head. In a flash I was
on him. I had raised my fists on each side for a smashing blow on his
temples. He was unable to get away, for he was so short that my arms
could have nailed him as he tried. He saw there was no escape, and the
sight of my face blazing with fury and wretchedness made him drop his
sword. I relished that moment, I gloated over it. I kept my fists going
backwards and forwards nearly touching his temples, but never quite.
I tried to imagine the agony in his rabbit-like mind, waiting for the
crushing blow to fall upon him, and wondering what it would feel like.
Suddenly he turned a sickly green. His hat was knocked all on one side.
I saw beneath his uniform a fat little vulgar bourgeois, incapable of a
thought outside the satisfying of his own senses. He turned from green
to a pasty yellow. He glanced piteously up into my distorted face.
I drove him back towards the door, growling and hissing at him, my
fists going like a steam hammer on each side of his head. His agony
became worse. His eyes flew from one side to the other, like a rabbit
looking for escape. His little pointed flaxen beard wobbled and, such
was his panic, so did his stomach. Suddenly my mind changed, and taking
him by the shoulders, and putting my knee, as far as it was possible,
into his belly, I pushed him backwards, and he sat down violently and
disconsolately in the passage outside, his sword underneath him, and
his hat rolling away into the darkness. I slammed the door, and after
a time he got up and locked it. I knew nothing would happen to me, for
he was not permitted to hit me, but had I hit him back, I gasp to think
of the number of years I should now be doing.

This, the third prison I had been in, was the worst. Physically it was
slightly better: there was more space, light, two good meals a day, but
the very last drop of individuality was taken away from you. It was not
permitted even to arrange the bowls on the shelf as you liked. I never
saw daylight, for our exercise took place at half-past six in the dark.
It was now the 20th of January. I had been arrested in the early days
of October. Since then I had been residing in a lavatory. I found it
dull.

Despite the warder's announcement that nobody ever came there for less
than three or four months, I was suddenly taken away again after five
days, and Black Maria drove me back once more to the Polizeigefängnis
of the Alexanderplatz. I was too miserable by now to care where I was
sent or what they did to me. I was beginning to lose the power of
appreciating anything--whatever its nature. I found some new arrivals
at Alexanderplatz. The place was full as usual with neutrals who were
under suspicion: Dutch, Swedes and Danes. One Dutchman had been there
for seven weeks in solitary. I was just reaching the final depths of
despair when, one night, just as I had got my first foot into bed, the
door was flung open, and into the gloom a voice shouted "'raus."[6] I
"raused" timidly and in my nightshirt, and was told to dress quickly. I
did so, surmising I was to go to another prison. I began to feel quite
numb, and I no longer hoped for anything. Downstairs in the bureau a
very pleasant policeman took charge of me, and after having signed the
receipts for the acceptance of my carcase, he made the usual remark,
"Kommen Sie mit," and off we went. I thought it odd that we should go
alone: they usually fetch the criminals in batches. "Where are we going
to?" I asked. "Ruhleben," he said.


VI--ON THE ROAD TO RUHLEBEN PRISON

For a moment I could hardly feel. I hardly dared feel. I just breathed
quietly to myself, and thought how nice the air tasted. I was going to
see human beings again. For a time the words were rather meaningless,
and then I gradually began to revive under their warmth. We went out
into the street to the Alexanderplatz station. I had a fine opportunity
to run away here, though I should have been a fool to have done so,
and to have invited prison again. In any case, I had no glasses with
me, and I was very short-sighted. We had gone up on to the platform,
and I was chuckling and giggling like a schoolgirl at seeing life once
again, when the policeman discovered it was the wrong one. "Run," he
said, "there's our train over there." I ran like a leopard. In ten
bounds I had slipped through the crowd and had lost him. I ran on
down the stairs, and into the street. How glorious it all seemed, and
I roared aloud with laughter, at which a sallow-faced woman in black
seemed offended and turned round to stare. I rushed on, up the other
set of stairs and in time my captor appeared. The idea of bolting had
just entered my head and flown, but "no," I said, "wait till we get to
Ruhleben, and have got tired of that, then we'll see what can be done."

Meanwhile, I stared out into the darkness from the brightly-lit
carriage as we steamed through the suburbs of Berlin. I got a glimpse
of a tiny room, in which numbers of steaming dishevelled women were
crowded together bending over machines and needlework. They were being
sweated. That was their daily life. They too, lived in what was really
a prison, though no law stopped them roaming whence they would. I was
in the world once more....

(The prisoner relates numerous stories of his experiences, of which
the above is but a single instance. He describes the prison; how it
feels waiting to be shot; the impressions of a lunatic on release
from solitary confinement and his daring escape with Mr. Edward Falk,
District Commissioner in the Political Service of Nigeria.)

AN AMERICAN AT BATTLE OF THE SOMME WITH FRENCH ARMY

_Army Life With the Soldiers Along the Somme_

_Told by Frederick Palmer, American War Correspondent_

  Mr. Palmer was the only accredited correspondent who had freedom
  of the field in the Battles of the Somme. At the time of this
  writing he has been officially appointed as a member of the staff
  of General Pershing, with the American Armies in France. This
  American has become a world figure. His life has been spent on the
  battlefields of the modern wars: The Greek War, the Philippine
  War, the Macedonian Insurrection, the Central American Wars, the
  Russian-Japanese War, the Turkish Revolution, the Balkan Wars. At
  the beginning of the Great War, he was with the British army and
  fleet. His descriptions of the fighting are unsurpassed in the
  war's literature--it is "the epic touch of great events." He has
  made a notable historical record in his book entitled "My Second
  Year of the War," in which he presents graphic pictures of the
  grim fighting along the Somme, with admirable descriptions of the
  heroism of the Canadians, the Australians and the fighters from all
  parts of the Earth, who are giving their lives "to make the world
  safe for Democracy." A single chapter from Mr. Palmer's book is

[7] I--STORY OF THE BATTLE RIDGE ON THE SOMME

Sometimes it occurred to one to consider what history might say about
the Ridge and also to wonder how much history, which pretends to know
all, would really know. Thus, one sought perspective of the colossal
significance of the uninterrupted battle whose processes numbed
the mind and to distinguish the meaning of different stages of the
struggle. Nothing had so well reflected the character of the war or
of its protagonists, French, British and German, as this grinding of
resources, of courage, and of will of three powerful races.

... It is historically accepted, I think, that the first decisive
phase was the battle of the Marne when Paris was saved. The second was
Verdun, when the Germans again sought a decision on the Western front
by an offensive of sledge-hammer blows against frontal positions; and,
perhaps, the third came when on the Ridge the British and the French
kept up their grim, insistent, piece-meal attacks, holding the enemy
week in and week out on the defensive, aiming at mastery as the scales
trembled in the new turn of the balance and initiative passed from one
side to the other in the beginning of that new era.

This scarred slope with its gentle ascent, this section of farming land
with its woods growing more ragged every day from shell fire, with its
daily and nightly thunders, its trickling procession of wounded and
prisoners down the communication trenches speaking the last word in
human bravery, industry, determination and endurance--this might one
day be not only the monument to the positions of all the battalions
that had fought, its copses, its villages, its knolls famous to future
generations as in Little Round Top with us, but in its monstrous
realism be an immortal expression, unrealized by those who fought, of a
commander's iron will and foresight in gaining that supremacy in arms,
men and material which was the genesis of the great decision.

The German began drawing away divisions from the Verdun sector,
bringing guns to answer the British and French fire and men whose
prodigal use alone could enforce his determination to maintain _morale_
and prevent any further bold strokes such as that of July (1916).

His sausage balloons began to reappear in the sky as the summer
wore on; he increased the number of his aeroplanes; more of his
five-point-nine howitzers were sending their compliments; he stretched
out his shell fire over communication trenches and strong points;
mustered great quantities of lachrymatory shells and for the first
time used gas shells with a generosity which spoke his faith in their
efficacy. The lachrymatory shell makes your eyes smart, and the Germans
apparently considered this a great auxiliary to high explosives and
shrapnel. Was it because of the success of the first gas attack at
Ypres that they now placed such reliance in gas shells? The shell when
it lands seems a "dud," which is a shell that has failed to explode;
then it blows out a volume of gas.

"If one hit right under your nose," said a soldier, "and you hadn't
your gas mask on, it might kill you. But when you see one fall
you don't run to get a sniff in order to accommodate the Boche by
asphyxiating yourself."

Another soldier suggested that the Germans had a big supply on hand and
were working off the stock for want of other kinds. The British who by
this time were settled in the offensive joked about the deluge of gas
shells with a gallant, amazing humor. Going up to the Ridge was going
to their regular duty. They did not shirk it or hail it with delight.
They simply went, that was all, when it was a battalion's turn to go.


II--GUNNERS IN THE FURNACE OF WAR

July heat became August heat as the grinding proceeded. The gunners
worked in their shirts or stripped to the waist. Sweat streaks mapped
the faces of the men who came out of the trenches. Stifling clouds of
dust hung over the roads, with the trucks phantom-like as they emerged
from the gritty mist and their drivers' eyes peered out of masks of
gray which clung to their faces. A fall of rain comes as a blessing
to Briton and German alike. German prisoners worn with exhaustion had
complexions the tint of their uniforms. If the British seemed weary
sometimes, one had only to see the prisoners to realize that the
defensive was suffering more than the offensive. The fatigue of some of
the men was of the kind that one week's sleep or a month's rest will
not cure; something fixed in their beings.

It was a new kind of fighting for the Germans. They smarted under it,
they who had been used to the upper hand. In the early stages of the
war their artillery had covered their well-ordered charges; they had
been killing the enemy with gunfire. Now the Allies were returning the
compliment; the shoe was on the other foot. A striking change, indeed,
from "On to Paris!" the old battle-cry of leaders who had now come to
urge these men to the utmost of endurance and sacrifice by telling them
that if they did not hold against the relentless hammering of British
and French guns what had been done to French villages would be done to
their own.

Prisoners spoke of peace as having been promised as close at hand by
their officers. In July the date had been set as Sept. 1st. Later, it
was set as Nov. 1st. The German was as a swimmer trying to reach shore,
in this case peace, with the assurance of those who urged him on that a
few more strokes would bring him there. Thus have armies been urged on
for years.

Those fighting did not have, as had the prisoners, their eyes opened
to the vast preparations behind the British lines to carry on the
offensive. Mostly the prisoners were amiable, peculiarly unlike the
proud men taken in the early days of the war when confidence in their
"system" as infallible was at its height. Yet there were exceptions. I
saw an officer marching at the head of the survivors of his battalion
along the road from Montauban one day with his head up, a cigar stuck
in the corner of his mouth at an aggressive angle, his unshaven chin
and dusty clothes heightening his attitude of "You go to ----, you
English!"

The hatred of the British was a strengthening factor in the defense.
Should they, the Prussians, be beaten by New Army men? No! Die first!
said Prussian officers. The German staff might be as good as ever, but
among the mixed troops--the old and the young, the hollow-chested and
the square-shouldered, mouth-breathers with spectacles and bent fathers
of families, vigorous boys in their late 'teens with the down still
on their cheeks and hardened veterans survivors of many battles east
and west--they were reverting appreciably to natural human tendencies
despite the iron discipline.

It was Skobeloff, if I recollect rightly, who said that out of every
hundred men twenty were natural fighters, sixty were average men who
would fight under impulse or when well led, and twenty were timid;
and armies were organized on the basis of the sixty average to make
them into a whole of even efficiency in action. The German staff had
supplied supreme finesse to this end. They had an army that was a
machine; yet its units were flesh and blood and the pounding of shell
fire and the dogged fighting on the Ridge must have an effect.

It became apparent through those two months of piece-meal advance that
the sixty average men were not as good as they had been. The twenty
"funk-sticks," in army phrase, were given to yielding themselves if
they were without an officer, but the twenty natural fighters--well,
human psychology does not change. They were the type that made the
professional armies of other days, the brigands, too, and also those of
every class of society to whom patriotic duty had become an exaltation
approaching fanaticism. More fighting made them fight harder.


III--DEAD BODIES STRAPPED TO GUNS

Such became members of the machine-gun corps, which took an oath
never to surrender, and led bombing parties and posted themselves in
shell-craters to face the charges while shells fell thick around them,
or remained up in the trench taking their chances against curtains
of fire that covered an infantry charge, in the hope of being able
to turn on their own bullet spray for a moment before being killed.
Sometimes their dead bodies were found strapped to their guns, more
often probably by their own request, as an insurance against deserting
their posts, than by command.

Shell fire was the theatricalism of the struggle, the roar of guns its
thunder; but night or day the sound of the staccato of that little arch
devil of killing, the machine gun, coming from the Ridge seemed as true
an expression of what was always going on there as a rattlesnake's
rattle is of its character. Delville and High Woods and Guillemont
and Longueval and the Switch Trench--these are symbolic names of that
attrition, of the heroism of British persistence which would not take
No for answer.

You might think that you had seen ruins until you saw those of
Guillemont after it was taken. They were the granulation of bricks and
mortar and earth mixed by the blasts of shell fire which crushed solids
into dust and splintered splinters. Guillemont lay beyond Trônes Wood
across an open space where the German guns had full play. There was a
stone quarry on the outskirts, and a quarry no less than a farm like
Waterlot, which was to the northward, and Falfemont, to the southward
and flanking the village, formed shelter. It was not much of a quarry,
but it was a hole which would be refuge for reserves and machine guns.
The two farms, clear targets for British guns, had their deep dugouts
whose roofs were reinforced by the ruins that fell upon them against
penetration even by shells of large caliber. How the Germans fought to
keep Falfemont! Once they sent out a charge with the bayonet to meet a
British charge between walls of shell fire and there through the mist
the steel was seen flashing and vague figures wrestling.

Guillemont and the farms won and Ginchy which lay beyond won and the
British had their flank of high ground. Twice they were in Guillemont
but could not remain, though as usual they kept some of their gains. It
was a battle from dugout to dugout, from shelter to shelter of any kind
burrowed in the débris or in fields, with the British never ceasing
here or elsewhere to continue their pressure. And the débris of a
village had particular appeal; it yielded to the spade; its piles gave
natural cover.


IV--THE ARTILLERYMEN IN THE WOODS

A British soldier returning from one of the attacks as he hobbled
through Trônes Wood expressed to me the essential generalship of the
battle. He was outwardly as unemotional as if he were coming home from
his day's work, respectful and good-humored, though he had a hole in
both arms from machine-gun fire, a shrapnel wound in the heel, and
seemed a trifle resentful of the added tribute of another shrapnel
wound in his shoulder after he had left the firing-line and was on his
way to the casualty clearing station. Insisting that he could lift the
cigarette I offered him to his lips and light it, too, he said:

"We've only to keep at them, sir. They'll go."

So the British kept at them and so did the French at every point. Was
Delville Wood worse than High Wood? This is too nice a distinction in
torments to be drawn. Possess either of them completely and command
of the Ridge in that section was won. The edge of a wood on the side
away from your enemy was the easiest part to hold. It is difficult to
range artillery on it because of restricted vision, and the enemy's
shells aimed at it strike the trees and burst prematurely among his own
men. Other easy, relatively easy, places to hold are the dead spaces
of gullies and ravines. There you were out of fire and there you were
not; there you could hold and there you could not. Machine-gun fire and
shell fire were the arbiters of topography more dependable than maps.

Why all the trees were not cut down by the continual bombardments of
both sides was past understanding. There was one lone tree on the
skyline near Longueval which I had watched for weeks. It still had a
limb, yes, the luxury of a limb, the last time I saw it, pointing with
a kind of defiance in its immunity. Of course it had been struck many
times. Bits of steel were imbedded in its trunk; but only a direct hit
on the trunk will bring down a tree. Trees may be slashed and whittled
and nicked and gashed and still stand; and when villages have been
pulverized except for the timbering of the houses, a scarred shade tree
will remain.

Thus, trees in Delville Wood survived, naked sticks among fallen
and splintered trunks and upturned roots. How any man could have
survived was the puzzling thing. None could if he had remained there
continuously and exposed himself; but man is the most cunning of
animals. With gas mask and eye-protectors ready, steel helmet on his
head and his faithful spade to make himself a new hole whenever he
moved, he managed the incredible in self-protection. Earth piled back
of a tree-trunk would stop bullets and protect his body from shrapnel.
There he lay and there a German lay opposite him, except when attacks
were being made.

Not getting the northern edge of the woods the British began sapping
out in trenches to the east toward Ginchy, where the many contours
showed the highest ground in that neighborhood. New lines of trenches
kept appearing on the map, often with group names such as Coffee Alley,
Tea Lane and Beer Street, perhaps. Out in the open along the irregular
plateau the shells were no more kindly, the bombing and the sapping
no less diligent all the way to the windmill, where the Australians
were playing the same kind of a game. With the actual summit gained at
certain points, these had to be held pending the taking of the whole,
or of enough to permit a wave of men to move forward in a general
attack without its line being broken by the resistance of strong
points, which meant confusion.


V--STALKING A MACHINE GUN IN ITS LAIR

Before any charge the machine guns must be "killed." No initiative
of pioneer or Indian scout surpassed that exhibited in conquering
machine-gun positions. When a big game hunter tells you about having
stalked tigers, ask him if he has ever stalked a machine gun to its
lair.

As for the nature of the lair, here is one where a Briton "dug himself
in" to be ready to repulse any counter-attack to recover ground that
the British had just won. Some layers of sandbags are sunk level
with the earth with an excavation back of them large enough for a
machine-gun standard and to give the barrel swing and for the gunner,
who back of this had dug himself a well four or five feet deep of
sufficient diameter to enable him to huddle at the bottom in "stormy
weather." He was general and army, too, of this little establishment.
In the midst of shells and trench mortars, with bullets whizzing around
his head, he had to keep a cool aim and make every pellet which he
poured out of his muzzle count against the wave of men coming toward
him who were at his mercy if he could remain alive for a few minutes
and keep his head.

He must not reveal his position before his opportunity came. All around
where this Briton had held the fort there were shell-craters like the
dots of close shooting around a bull's-eye; no tell-tale blood spots
this time, but a pile of two or three hundred cartridge cases lying
where they had fallen as they were emptied of their cones of lead. Luck
was with the occupant, but not with another man playing the same game
not far away. Broken bits of gun and fragments of cloth mixed with
earth explained the fate of a German machine gunner who had emplaced
his piece in the same manner.

Before a charge, crawl up at night from shell-crater to shell-crater
and locate the enemy's machine guns. Then, if your own guns and the
trench mortars do not get them, go stalking with supplies of bombs and
remember to throw yours before the machine gunner, who also has a stock
for such emergencies, throws his. When a machine gun begins rattling
into a company front in a charge the men drop for cover, while officers
consider how to draw the devil's tusks. Arnold von Winkelried, who
gathered the spears to his breast to make a path for his comrades, won
his glory because the fighting forces were small in his day. But with
such enormous forces as are now engaged and with heroism so common, we
make only an incident of the officer who went out to silence a machine
gun and was found lying dead across the gun with the gunner dead beside
him.


VI--TALKS WITH THE MEN IN THE REAR

The advance on the map at our quarters extended as the brief army
reports were read into the squares every morning by the key of figures
and numerals with a detail that included every little trench, every
copse, every landmark, and then we chose where we would go that day.
At corps headquarters there were maps with still more details and
officers would explain the previous day's work to us. Every wood and
village, every viewpoint, we knew, and every casualty clearing station
and prisoners' inclosure. At battalion camps within sight of the Ridge
and within range of the guns, where their blankets helped to make
shelter from the sun, you might talk with the men out of the fight and
lunch and chat with the officers who awaited the word to go in again or
perhaps to hear that their tour was over and they could go to rest in
Ypres sector, which had become relatively quiet.

They had their letters and packages from home before they slept and
had written letters in return after waking; and there was nothing to
do now except to relax and breathe, to renew the vitality that had
been expended in the fierce work where shells were still threshing the
earth, which rose in clouds of dust to settle back again in enduring
passive resistance.

There was much talk early in the war about British cheerfulness; so
much that officers and men began to resent it as expressing the idea
that they took such a war as this as a kind of holiday, when it was
the last thing outside of Hades that any sane man would choose. It
was a question in my own mind at times if Hades would not have been a
pleasant change. Yet the characterization is true, peculiarly true,
even in the midst of the fighting on the Ridge. Cheerfulness takes
the place of emotionalism as the armor against hardship and death;
a good-humored balance between exhilaration and depression which
meets smile with smile and creates an atmosphere superior to all
vicissitudes. Why should we be downhearted? Why, indeed, when it does
no good. Not "Merrie England!" War is not a merry business; but an
Englishman may be cheerful for the sake of self and comrades.

Of course, these battalions, officers and men, would talk about when
the war would be over. Even the Esquimaux must have an opinion on the
subject by this time. That of the men who make the war, whose lives are
the lives risked, was worth more, perhaps, than that of people living
thousands of miles away; for it is they who are doing the fighting,
who will stop fighting. To them it would be over when it was won.
The time this would require varied with different men--one year, two
years; and again they would turn satirical and argue whether the sixth
or the seventh year would be the worst. And they talked shop about
the latest wrinkles in fighting; how best to avoid having men buried
by shell-bursts; the value of gas and lachrymatory shells; the ratio
of high explosives to shrapnel; methods of "cleaning out" dugouts or
"doing in" machine guns, all in a routine that had become an accepted
part of life like the details of the stock carried and methods of
selling in a department store.

Indelible the memories of these talks, which often brought out
illustrations of racial temperament. One company was more horrified
over having found a German tied to a trench _parados_ to be killed by
British shell fire as a field punishment than by the horrors of other
men equally mashed and torn, or at having crawled over the moist bodies
of the dead, or slept among them, or been covered with spatters of
blood and flesh--for that incident struck home with a sense of brutal
militarism which was the thing in their minds against which they were
fighting.


VII--WITH STEEL HELMETS AND GAS MASKS

With steel helmets on and gas masks over our shoulders, we would leave
our car at the dead line and set off to "see something," when now the
fighting was all hidden in the folds of the ground, or in the woods, or
lost on the horizon where the front line of either of these two great
armies, with their immense concentration of men and material and roads
gorged with transport and thousands of belching guns, was held by a
few men with machine guns in shell-craters, their positions sometimes
interwoven. Old hands in the Somme battle become shell-wise. They are
the ones whom the French call "varnished," which is a way of saying
that projectiles glance off their anatomy. They keep away from points
where the enemy will direct his fire as a matter of habit or scientific
gunnery, and always recollect that the German has not enough shells to
sow them broadcast over the whole battle area.

It is not an uncommon thing for one to feel quite safe within a couple
of hundred yards of an artillery concentration. That corner of a
village, that edge of a shattered grove, that turn in the highway, that
sunken road--keep away from them! Any kind of trench for shrapnel; lie
down flat unless a satisfactory dugout is near for protection from
high explosives which burst in the earth. If you are at the front and a
curtain of fire is put behind you, wait until it is over or go around
it. If there is one ahead, wait until another day--provided that you
are a spectator. Always bear in mind how unimportant you are, how small
a figure on the great field, and that if every shell fired had killed
one soldier there would not be an able-bodied man in uniform left alive
on the continent of Europe. By observing these simple rules you may see
a surprising amount with a chance of surviving.

One day I wanted to go into the old German dugouts under a formless
pile of ruins which a British colonel had made his battalion
headquarters; but I did not want to go enough to persist when I
understood the situation. Formerly, my idea of a good dugout--and I
always like to be within striking distance of one--was a cave twenty
feet deep with a roof of four or five layers of granite, rubble and
timber; but now I feel more safe if the fragments of a town hall are
piled on top of this.

The Germans were putting a shell every minute with clockwork regularity
into the colonel's "happy home" and at intervals four shells in a
salvo. You had to make a run for it between the shells, and if you did
not know the exact location of the dugout you might have been hunting
for it some time. Runners bearing messages took their chances both
going and coming and two men were hit. The colonel was quite safe
twenty feet underground with the matting of débris including that of
a fallen chimney overhead, but he was a most unpopular host. The next
day he moved his headquarters and not having been considerate enough to
inform the Germans of the fact they kept on methodically pounding the
roof of the untenanted premises.

After every battle "promenade" I was glad to step into the car waiting
at the "dead line," where the chauffeurs frequently had had harder luck
in being shelled than we had farther forward. Yet I know of no worse
place to be in than a car when you hear the first growing scream which
indicates that yours is the neighborhood selected by a German battery
or two for expending some of its ammunition. When you are in danger you
like to be on your feet and to possess every one of your faculties. I
used to put cotton in my ears when I walked through the area of the
gun positions as some protection to the eardrums from the blasts, but
always took it out once I was beyond the big calibers, as an acute
hearing after some experience gave you instant warning of any "krump"
or five-point-nine coming in your direction, advising you which way to
dodge and also saving you from unnecessarily running for a dugout if
the shell were passing well overhead or short.

I was glad, too, when the car left the field quite behind and was
over the hills in peaceful country. But one never knew. Fifteen miles
from the front line was not always safe. Once when a sudden outburst
of fifteen-inch naval shells sent the people of a town to cover and
scattered fragments over the square, one cut open the back of the
chauffeur's head just as we were getting into our car.

"Are you going out to be strafed at?" became an inquiry in the mess on
the order of "Are you going to take an afternoon off for golf to-day?"
The only time I felt that I could claim any advantage in phlegm over
my comrades was when I slept through two hours of aerial bombing with
anti-aircraft guns busy in the neighborhood, which, as I explained, was
no more remarkable than sleeping in a hotel at home with flat-wheeled
surface cars and motor horns screeching under your window. A subway
employee or a traffic policeman in New York ought never to suffer from
shell-shock if he goes to war.

The account of personal risk which in other wars might make a magazine
article or a book chapter, once you sat down to write it, melted away
as your ego was reduced to its proper place in the cosmos. Individuals
had never been so obscurely atomic. With hundreds of thousands
fighting, personal experience was valuable only as it expressed that of
the whole. Each story brought back to the mess was much like others,
thrilling for the narrator and repetition for the polite listener,
except it was some officer fresh from the communication trench who
brought news of what was going on in that day's work.

Thus, the battle had become static; its incidents of a kind like the
product of some mighty mill. The public, falsely expecting that the
line would be broken, wanted symbols of victory in fronts changing on
the map and began to weary of the accounts. It was the late Charles A.
Dana who is credited with saying: "If a dog bites a man it is not news,
but if a man bites a dog it is."

Let the men attack with hatchets and in evening dress and this would
win all the headlines in the land because people at their breakfast
tables would say: "Here is something new in the war!" Men killing men
was not news, but a battalion of trained bloodhounds sent out to bite
the Germans would have been. I used to try to hunt down some of the
"novelties" which received the favor of publication, but though they
were well known abroad the man in the trenches had heard nothing about
them.

Bullets, shells, bayonets and bombs remained the tried and practical
methods there on the Ridge with its overpowering drama, any act of
which almost any day was greater than Spionkop or Magersfontein which
thrilled a world that was not then war-stale; and ever its supreme
feature was that determination which was like a kind fate in its
progress of chipping, chipping at a stone foundation that must yield.


VIII--VICTORY!--"THE RIDGE IS TAKEN"

The Ridge seeped in one's very existence. You could see it as clearly
in imagination as in reality, with its horizon under shell-bursts and
the slope with its maze of burrows and its battered trenches. Into
those calm army reports association could read many indications: the
telling fact that the German losses in being pressed off the Ridge were
as great if not greater than the British, their sufferings worse under
a heavier deluge of shell fire, the increased skill of the offensive
and the failure of German counter-attacks after each advance.

No one doubted that the Ridge would be taken and taken it was, or
all of it that was needed for the drive that was to clean up any
outstanding points, with its sweep down into the valley. A victory
this, not to be measured by territory; for in one day's rush more
ground was gained than in two months of siege. A victory of position,
of will, of _morale_! Sharpening its steel and wits on enemy steel and
wits in every kind of fighting, the New Army had proved itself in the
supreme test of all qualities.

AN AMERICAN'S EXPERIENCES "INSIDE THE GERMAN EMPIRE"

_Told by Herbert Bayard Swope, an American in Berlin_


  These experiences and observations inside the German Empire in the
  third year of the War form an invaluable narrative. They have been
  recognized by one of the leading American universities as the most
  important contribution of a journalist to the literature of the
  Great War. Hon. James W. Gerard, American Ambassador to the German
  Empire, says: "The facts and experiences ... (of Herbert Bayard
  Swope), gathered first-hand by the author, whose friendship I
  value and whose professional equipment I admire, form an important
  contribution to contemporaneous history." Mr. Swope says: "My
  volume is based upon a series of articles I wrote for the _New York
  World_, and I am grateful to Mr. Ralph Pulitzer of that paper, for
  permission to use the material in this form." This inspiring book
  is published by _The Century Company_: Copyright, 1917, with whose
  authority this chapter is given.

[8] I--JOURNEYS IN THE SPY-BESIEGED LAND

Germany to-day is a giant fortress completely ringed by besiegers.
Every man, woman, and child, all the beasts of burden and food, are
checked and located. The doors have been locked against travelers
seeking to enter and those seeking to depart. Only in exceptional cases
are visitors received, and in rarer instances are natives permitted to
leave.

The police are able at all times to account for every one of the
population, passport issuance has been made extremely difficult, the
ordeal of search and inquest at the frontier is severe and thorough,
interior travel has been sharply restricted, every foot of the border
is guarded against illegal entry, obstacles have been put in the way
of mail and telegraph communications, the espionage system has been
multiplied in efficiency and extent--all for the safety of the empire.
And because this is the underlying reason for them, the Germans have
submitted to the restrictions willingly, and, instead of rebelling, aid
them.

The spy mania that swept over war-ridden Europe two years ago has
lessened in its visible intensity in Germany, but the precaution
against spies has been increased. The people have confidence in the
safeguards against espionage, and so suspicion has been quieted. How
well this confidence is justified can be attested by any one who has
been inside the empire in the second year of the war.

A stranger is under observation from the time he enters until he has
left. The watchfulness is not obtrusive, it is rarely evident; but it
is always thorough. Within twelve hours of a visitor's arrival he must
report in person at the nearest police station, and every time he makes
a railroad journey this operation must be repeated.

When an American undertakes a voyage to Germany, the wheels of the
imperial Government begin to revolve immediately upon the first
application for a visé to his passport being made in this country.
The first question to be answered concerns the applicant's character,
so that Germany may feel sure he does not purpose to aid or abet her
enemies; and the second, the actual need of the business that causes
him to make the trip. Obtaining a passport from the American Government
is attended by many formalities, and these are renewed when the German
consul-generals are asked to approve.

Germany insists that a fortnight intervene between the application for
a visé and the beginning of the trip. This is to enable her officials
to make the necessary investigations, and then to communicate the facts
to Berlin and to the traveler's port of arrival.

All travel between America and Germany is through Copenhagen,
Stockholm, or Rotterdam. From Copenhagen the traveler enters Germany
through Warnemunde; from Stockholm he enters through Sassnitz; and
from Rotterdam through Bentheim. Upon his arrival at one of the three
neutral cities he must begin the proceedings afresh....

Upon arrival at Warnemunde (the methods throughout the empire are
standardized, and are the same at every other entrance point) the
travelers are shunted into a long low wooden shed, carrying their hand
baggage, having previously surrendered the checks for their heavier
luggage. Upon entering the place they are given numbers, and in return
surrender their passports to brisk, keen-eyed, non-commissioned
officers, whose efficiency has been increased by long practice.


II--"SEARCHED" BY THE SECRET POLICE

Once in the room, the travelers are not permitted to leave except
through one door, and that they pass only when their numbers are
called. Barred windows and armed sentries prevent any trifling with
this system. The numbers are called one by one except in the case of
husbands and wives, who are permitted to go through together--and when
this is reached, the traveler passes through into a second office,
where he is questioned as to his identity and the photographs on the
passports are verified.

While he is undergoing this questioning he is being overheard and
carefully watched by numbers of the _geheim-Polizei_ (secret police),
some of whom are in uniform and others of whom masquerade in civilian
attire as new arrivals. If there is any error in his papers it is
developed at this point, and he is at once turned about and sent back
to Copenhagen. But if it is a case of _alles in Ordnung_ (everything in
order), it is so reported, and he is ushered into another room, where,
having passed the first two inquisitorial chambers, he is submitted to
the grand ordeal, that of search.

And what a search it is! Unless one's credentials are exceptionally
strong, one is stripped and one's mouth, ears, nose, and other parts
of the body examined. One's fountain pen is emptied, every piece of
paper taken away, including visiting cards, and even match-boxes are
confiscated. Finger rings, umbrellas and canes are inspected. If
bandages are worn, these must be stripped off, too. No distinction is
drawn between men and women beyond the fact that women are of course
examined before female inspectors.

The bodily search having been completed, that of the clothing is begun.
Every article of apparel is felt over carefully and exposed to a
strong light for fear there may be writing on the lining. If there is
the slightest reason for suspicion, the travelers are given a sponge
bath of water with a large admixture of citric acid, which has the
effect of making apparent any writing on the body that may have been
done with invisible ink. The Germans say that these precautions have
been necessitated by the ingenious ruses employed by spies, whose
entrance into the country is considered a greater menace than is their
departure, since in entering they bring with them instructions to their
confederates already within the empire awaiting orders.

The next step is the examination of the baggage, and this is done in
a manner to make the American customs inspection seem childish. The
interior and exterior measurements of the trunks are taken to guard
against false sides, tops, and bottoms, and then one by one every
article the trunks contain is put through a separate inspection....

Every sort of liquid is confiscated. The perfumes of the women are
poured into a big tub, and such liquors as the men may be carrying are
treated in a similar manner. The contents of travelers' alcohol or
spirit lamps are carefully emptied into air-tight containers for later
use. The reason for the drastic regulation against taking any liquid,
however small the quantity, into Germany was the danger of the fact
that high explosives such as nitroglycerine can be carried in small
vessels. On several occasions, the Germans say, railroads and bridges
have been blown up by the enemy travelers who carried the means of
destruction in this way. In this connection the additional precaution
is taken by the authorities of prohibiting all travelers from putting
their heads out the windows of the coupés while crossing bridges.

All written or printed matter, such as books, newspapers, pamphlets,
magazines, is taken away. Upon request the traveler may have these
forwarded to his point of destination after they have been censored
and deleted. As every point on the German border is carefully guarded,
it is virtually impossible for any one to enter the country except at
stated points. All the roads are closed, and the border fields are
carefully patrolled.

Upon his arrival in Berlin, or wherever he may be bound, the traveler
must present himself in person at the nearest police station. There his
passport is again viséd, and he is given official permission to remain
for a given period. But every time he makes a trip he must report
himself going and coming....


III--THE COUNTRY THAT WENT "SPY MAD"

In every hotel are to be met spies in the form of guests, waiters,
chambermaids, telephone operators, and bartenders. In the early part of
the war these last proved their worth often, for men otherwise cautious
and reticent became outspoken under the influence of a few Scotches or
cocktails, which are still in vogue in Germany despite their American
origin.

At one of the biggest of the Berlin hotels it is a noticeable fact that
all the floor waiters are young, active, highly intelligent men. When
they are asked why they are not serving at the front all have excuses
on the score of health. The truth is that they are all governmental
agents whose duty it is to familiarize themselves with the details of
every visitor's business. That they do well. Every stranger's papers
are thoroughly investigated, no matter how securely they may be locked
up, before he has been in the city two days, assuming he leaves them in
his room. Two members of the American diplomatic corps who made short
stays in Berlin can tell singular stories on this point.

The chief of the floor waiters at this hotel--and it is illustrative of
all the others--is a polished-mannered young fellow of about thirty-two
who speaks English, French, Italian, Spanish, and Danish with the same
facility that he reads them, and he reads them as well as he does his
native German. I noticed the chief of the telephone operators, who
while discharging the duties of his lowly job wore livery, attending
the races in an English sport-coat, with glasses strung over his
shoulders, and he went to and from the course in a taxicab, the height
of luxury in wartime Berlin. One would hardly credit his income solely
to the measly wages he received from his work at the switch-board. He,
too, as well as his assistants, was an accomplished linguist.

It must not be thought that espionage is confined to the Americans.
On the contrary, even the subjects of Germany's allies receive this
attention. Austrian, Bulgarian, or Turkish, it makes no difference; all
are put under the scrutiny of the secret eyes and ears of the Kaiser.
Almost it is more difficult to obtain a passport permitting one to
travel to Austria than it is to obtain one for a journey to America,
and the examination at the Austrian border is just as severe as at the
frontier between Germany and Denmark.

German spies travel on all the transatlantic liners running from
Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Holland to America, and back again. They
find out as much as they can about their fellow-travelers, so that
the secret police may be forewarned as to whom and what they are to
receive. These agents are rarely employed by the German Government for
the secret transmission of mail; that is usually done by men of solid
reputation, American or other neutrals who are persuaded to accept the
task on the ground of a service to the empire. Obviously, they must be
violently pro-German before they are asked to assume the undertaking.

The difficulty of communication is one of the severe hardships that
the German Government and people suffer. Mails to and from the empire
are seized by the Allies, and if delivered at all, are so belated as
to make them valueless. Only such cables as the Allies choose to pass
are permitted transmission. Male Germans are not permitted to travel
on the seas. So German communication is restricted to the wireless, to
supposedly neutral couriers, and to submarines, both of the commercial
type as the _Deutschland_, and of the war type, which have been
secretly conveying important German mail to Spanish waters, where it
is loaded upon friendly neutral vessels, which carry it into Spanish
ports and thence forward it to America and other points. This last
method has been a carefully guarded secret of the German Government.
Mail sent out by Spain is not seized and censored by the Allies....


IV--A VISIT TO GENERAL LORINGHOVEN

To get the official view of the situation held by the officers of
the general staff, I called on General von Freytag-Loringhoven at
the general staff building in Berlin, where the great Moltke long
presided. He received me in a room the distinguishing features of which
were maps, not only showing the disposition of the German forces, but
immense wall-sized ones on which were diagrammed the present locations
of the Allies, showing their number, their commanders (designated
by name and locations of headquarters), with their relative ranks
indicated by little parti-coloured flags. I had just returned from
the Somme, and as I saw how each of the French and British lines was
clearly marked, I expressed my surprise.

The general smiled.

"Yes, our intelligence department is pretty thorough," he said, "but it
is no better on the Somme than our enemy's is, for in France, where we
stand on occupied soil, almost every civilian is an aid to the Allies.

"But despite that, despite all the French and English can do at the
Somme," he went on, "they will never break through."...

I asked the general for his impressions of the French and British
soldiers. He answered:

"The French are better soldiers. They are better schooled and drilled.
They have been at it longer and they are enormously brave and
sacrificing. But the British are proving their worth, too. They are
all of them warlike and like to fight, but they don't know how as yet.
You can't make a soldier in a few weeks or months; it takes time and
patience.

"The French artillery is exceptional. The French artillery officers
have always been of high repute. They are teaching much to the English
and Russians, and these forces are showing a corresponding betterment.

"Because of their greater experience, I should say the French are
better officered than the English. The Russian officers are a poor lot.
There is no sympathy between them and their men. The men are brave
enough, but are sheep-like in their lack of intelligence...."

In September, I stood in the general's field headquarters and watched
the big guns drop shells all around the famous "windmill of Pozières"
on the high ridge which had been taken by the British and was being
used by their artillery observers, who gamely held on, although the
position was anything but comfortable.

While we watched the bombardment a squadron of English fliers passed
overhead. I ducked and made for the bomb-proof.

"Don't worry," said the general, "the fliers rarely bomb us. Our
aviators generally leave their generals' headquarters alone, and they
usually do the same by us. It is a sort of understood courtesy."...

While I stood in his observation-point with Wenninger an iron-gray
quartermaster sergeant passed. He had been in the east against the
Russians as well as in the west. In reply to my question as to his
opinion of the schools of fighting, he answered:

"I'd rather face twenty infantry attacks from the Russians than bring
up food to the first lines here (British). Their damned artillery makes
it hell."


V--"AT THE SOMME, I MET VON PAPEN"

At the Somme I met Captain von Papen, the former German military
attaché, who was sent home by America. After six weeks on the firing
line he was made chief of staff to General Count Schweinitz, commanding
the Fourth Guard Division and holding the Grevillers-Warlencourt-Ligny
line. He has proved himself an efficient officer.

Captain Boy-Ed, the naval attaché, who was sent back to Germany at
the same time, is now chief intelligence officer at the admiralty
in Berlin. He is very bitter toward America, while von Papen is
friendly. Dr. Dernburg, the other propagandist who was returned to the
fatherland, is philosophical as regards his work in America, and is
without rancour over his treatment. He is living in Berlin, working
on housing plans for the poor, but he has lost the confidence of his
Government....

All the world knows Hindenburg. Germany's Iron Man, the hero of the
Masurian Swamps, a colossal wooden statue of whom stands opposite the
Reichstag in the Sieges-allee, the Avenue of Victory, in Berlin's
Tiergarten. But who is Ludendorff?

Ludendorff is Germany's man of mystery, the grim, inscrutable,
silent man whose picture is on sale in every shop, whose name is in
every mouth, but whose real personality is hidden even from his own
countrymen.

Ludendorff is Hindenburg's indispensable right-hand man....

There are those who say that Ludendorff is Hindenburg's brain,
and that Hindenburg's greatest successes have been planned by his
silent, retiring assistant. Hindenburg, when in the mood, becomes
very talkative and chatty, and at such times he often attributes his
success to his assistant. There is a perfect harmony between the two;
Ludendorff plans and Hindenburg decides....

On August 28 (1914) it was announced that the Russians were fleeing
across the border. The news grew. Five army corps and three cavalry
divisions had been annihilated. More than ninety thousand prisoners
were taken. Tannenberg, one of the greatest victories of the war, had
changed the whole face of affairs in the east.

There have been bigger battles and longer battles, and there have been
battles of more significance in the history of the war, but there has
been no other battle in which the result has been so overwhelming and
complete a victory for either side.

Just what happened at Tannenberg and in the Masurian Swamps is still
a secret. There have been stories that a hundred thousand men were
drowned in the swamps. There have been tales of dikes released and men
swept away in a swirl of rushing waters. All that is known certainly is
that a Russian army disappeared.

(This American war correspondent then gives his impressions of men
and events within the German Armies, telling many interesting tales
of Boelcke, the German "knight of the air" who shot down thirty-eight
enemy aeroplanes before he was killed in collision with one of his own
German machines.)

"DIXMUDE"-AN EPIC OF THE FRENCH MARINES

_Story of the Murder of Commander Jeanniot_

_Told by Charles Le Goffic of the Fusiliers Marins--Translated by
Florence Simmonds_

  The story of the French Marines is one of the epics of the World's
  Wars. Such is the story of the Bretons. At Dixmude, under command
  of their own officers, retaining not only the costume, but the soul
  and language of their profession they were still sailors. Grouped
  with them were seamen from all the naval stations. The heroism of
  these sailors is told in the volume entitled "Dixmude," published
  by _J. B. Lippincott Company_. From these interesting stories, we
  here relate "The Murder of Captain Jeanniot."

[9] I-GREAT HEARTS OF THE FRENCH MARINES

I had opportunities of talking to several of these "Parigots," and I
should not advise anyone to speak slightingly of their officers before
them, though, indeed, so few of these have survived that nine times
out of ten the quip could be aimed only at a ghost. The deepest and
tenderest words I heard uttered concerning Naval Lieutenant Martin
des Pallières were spoken by a Marine of the Rue des Martyrs, George
Delaballe, who was one of his gunners in front of the cemetery the
night when his machine-guns were jammed, and five hundred Germans, led
by a major wearing the Red Cross armlet, threw themselves suddenly into
our trenches.

"But why did you love him so?" I asked.

"I don't know.... We loved him because he was brave, and was always
saying things that made us laugh, ... but above all because he loved
us."

Here we have the secret of this extraordinary empire of the officers
over their men, the explanation of that miracle of a four weeks'
resistance, one against six, under the most formidable tempest of
shells of every caliber that ever fell upon a position, in a shattered
town where all the buildings were ablaze, and where, to quote the words
of a _Daily Telegraph_ correspondent, it was no longer light or dark,
"but only red." When the Boches murdered Commander Jeanniot, his men
were half crazy. They would not have felt the death of a father more
deeply. I have recently had a letter sent me written by a Breton lad,
Jules Cavan, who was wounded at Dixmude. While he was in hospital at
Bordeaux he was visited by relatives of Second-Lieutenant Gautier, who
was killed on October 27 in the cemetery trenches.

"Dear Sir," he wrote to M. Dalché de Desplanels the following day,
"you cannot imagine how your visit went to my heart.... On October 19,
when my battalion took the offensive at Lannes, three kilometers from
Dixmude, I was wounded by a bullet in the thigh. I dragged myself along
as best I could on the battlefield, bullets falling thickly all around
me. I got over about five hundred meters on the battlefield and reached
the road. Just at that moment Lieutenant Gautier, who was coming
towards me with a section, seeing me in the ditch, asked: 'Well, my
lad, what is the matter with you?' 'Oh, Lieutenant, I am wounded in the
leg, and I cannot drag myself further.' 'Here then, get on my back.'
And he carried me to a house at Lannes, and said these words, which I
shall never forget: 'Stay there, my lad, till they come and fetch you.
I will let the motor ambulance men know.' Then he went off under the
fire. Oh, the splendid fellow!"


II--TALES OF THE BRAVE "PARIGOTS"

"The splendid fellow!" Jules Cavan echoes Georges Delaballe, the
Breton, the "Parigot." There is the same heartfelt ring in the words of
each. And sometimes, as I muse over these heroic shades, I ask myself
which were the more admirable, officers or men. When Second-Lieutenant
Gautier received orders to take the place of Lieutenant de Pallières,
buried by a shell in the trench of the cemetery where Lieutenant Eno
had already fallen, he read his fate plainly; he said: "It's my turn."
And he smiled at Death, who beckoned him. But I know of one case when,
as Death seemed about to pass them by, the Marines provoked it; when,
after they had used up all their cartridges and were surrounded in a
barn, twelve survivors only remaining with their captain, the latter,
filled with pity for them, and recognizing the futility of further
resistance, said to his men: "My poor fellows, you have done your duty.
There is nothing for it but to surrender." Then, disobedient to their
captain for the first time, they answered: "No!" To my mind nothing
could show more clearly the degree of sublime exaltation and complete
self-forgetfulness to which our officers had raised the _moral_ of
their men. Such were the pupils these masters in heroism had formed,
that often their own pupils surpassed them. There was at the Trouville
Hospital a young Breton sailor called Michel Folgoas. His wound was
one of the most frightful imaginable: the whole of his side was shaved
off by a shell which killed one of his comrades in the trenches, who
was standing next to him, on November 2. "I," he remarks in a letter,
"was completely stunned at first. When I came to myself I walked three
hundred meters before I noticed that I was wounded, and this was
only when my comrades called out: '_Mon Dieu_, they have carried away
half your side.'" It was true. But does he groan and lament over it?
He makes a joke of it: "The Boches were so hungry that they took a
beef-steak out of my side, but this won't matter, as they have left me
a little."

Multiply this Michel Folgoas by 6,000, and you will have the brigade.
This inferno of Dixmude was an inferno where everyone made the best
of things. And the _battues_ of rabbits, the coursing of the red
German hares which were running in front of the army of invasion,
the bull-fights in which our Mokos impaled some pacific Flemish bull
abandoned by its owners; more dubious escapades, sternly repressed, in
the underground premises of the Dixmude drink-shops; a story of two
Bretons who went off on a foraging expedition and were seen coming back
along the canal in broad daylight towing a great cask of strong beer
which they had unearthed Heaven knows where at a time when the whole
brigade, officers as well as men, had nothing to drink but the brackish
water of the Yser--these, and a hundred other tales of the same kind,
which will some day delight village audiences gathered round festal
evening fires, bear witness that Jean Gouin (or Le Gwenn, John the
White, as the sailors call themselves familiarly[10]), did not lose his
bearings even in his worst vicissitudes.

Dixmude was an epic then, or, as M. Victor Giraud proposes, a French
_geste_, but a _geste_ in which the heroism is entirely without
solemnity or deliberation, where the nature of the seaman asserts
itself at every turn, where there are thunder, lightning, rain, mud,
cold, bullets, shrapnel, high explosive shells, and all the youthful
gaiety of the French race.

And this epic did not come to an end at Dixmude. The brigade did not
ground arms after November 10. The gaps in its ranks being filled from
the dépôts, it was kept up to the strength of two regiments, and reaped
fresh laurels. At Ypres and Saint Georges it charged the troops of
Prince Ruprecht of Bavaria and the Duke of Würtemberg in succession.
Dixmude was but one panel of the triptych: on the broken apex of the
black capital of the Communiers, on the livid backgrounds of the flat
country about Nieuport, twice again did the brigade inscribe its stormy
silhouette.

But at Ypres and Saint Georges the sailors had the bulk of the
Anglo-French forces behind them; at Dixmude up to November 4 they
knew that their enterprise was a forlorn hope. And in their hands
they held the fate of the two Flanders. One of the heroes of Dixmude,
Naval Lieutenant Georges Hébert, said that the Fusiliers had gained
more than a naval battle there. My only objection to this statement
is its modesty. Dixmude was our Thermopylæ in the north, as the
Grand-Couronné, near Nancy, was our Thermopylæ in the east; the
Fusiliers were the first and the most solid element of the long
triumphant defensive which will one day be known as the victory of the
Yser, a victory less decisive and perhaps less brilliant than that of
the Marne, but not less momentous in its consequences.

The Generalissimo is credited with a dictum which he may himself have
uttered with a certain astonishment:

"You are my best infantrymen," said he to the Fusiliers.

We will close with these simply, soldierly words, more eloquent than
the most brilliant harangues. The brigade will reckon them among their
proudest trophies to all time.


III--STORY OF MURDER OF DR. DUGUET

On October 25 (1914), we had not yet received any help from the
inundation. Our troops were in dire need of rest, and the enemy was
tightening his grip along the entire front. New reinforcements were
coming up to fill the gaps in his ranks; our scouts warned us that
fresh troops were marching upon Dixmude by the three roads of Essen,
Beerst, and Woumen.[11] We had to expect a big affair the next day, if
not that very night. It came off that night.

About 7 o'clock the Gamas company went to relieve the men in the
southern trenches. On their way, immediately outside the town, they
fell in with a German force of about the same strength as themselves,
which had crept up no one knew how. There was a fusillade and a general
_mêlée_, in which our sailors opened a passage through the troop with
bayonets and butt-ends, disposing of some forty Germans and putting the
rest to flight.[12] Then there was a lull. The splash of rain was the
only sound heard till 2 A.M., when suddenly a fresh outbreak
of rifle-fire was heard near the Caeskerke station, right inside the
defences. It was suggested that our men or our allies, exasperated by
their life of continual alarms, had been carried away by some reckless
impulse. The bravest soldiers admit that hallucinations are not
uncommon at night in the trenches. All the pitfalls of darkness rise
before the mind; the circulation of the blood makes a noise like the
tramp of marching troops; if by chance a nervous sentry should fire his
rifle, the whole section will follow suit.

Convinced that some misunderstanding of this kind had taken place,
the Staff, still quartered at the Caeskerke railway station, shouted
to the sections to cease firing. As, however, the fusillade continued
in the direction of the town, the Admiral sent one of his officers,
Lieutenant Durand-Gasselin, to reconnoiter. He got as far as the Yser
without finding the enemy; the fusillade had ceased; the roads were
clear. He set out on his way back to Caeskerke. On the road he passed
an ambulance belonging to the brigade going up towards Dixmude, which,
on being challenged, replied: "Rouge Croix." Rather surprised at this
inversion, he stopped the ambulance; it was full of Germans, who,
however, surrendered without offering any resistance. But this capture
suggested a new train of thought to the Staff: they were now certain
that there had been an infantry raid upon the town; the Germans in
the ambulance probably belonged to a troop of mysterious assailants
who had made their way into Dixmude in the night and had vanished no
less mysteriously after this extraordinary deed of daring. One of our
covering trenches must have given way, but which? Our allies held the
railway line by which the enemy had penetrated into the defences,
sounding the charge.... The riddle was very disturbing, but under the
veil of a thick, damp night, which favored the enemy, it was useless
to seek a solution. It was found next morning at dawn, when one of
our detachments on guard by the Yser suddenly noticed in a meadow a
curious medley of Belgians, French Marines, and Germans. Had our men
been made prisoners? This uncertainty was of brief duration. There was
a sharp volley; the sailors fell; the Germans made off. This was what
had happened!

Various versions have been given of this incident, one of the most
dramatic of the defence, in the course of which the heroic Commander
Jeanniot and Dr. Duguet, chief officer of the medical staff, fell
mortally wounded, with several others. The general opinion, however,
seems to be that the German attack, which was delivered at 2:30 P.M.,
was closely connected with the surprise movement attempted at 7 o'clock
in the evening on the Essen road and so happily frustrated by the
intervention of the Gamas company. It is not impossible that it was
carried out by the fragments of the force we had scattered, reinforced
by new elements and charging to the sound of the bugle. This would
explain the interval of several hours between the two attacks, which
were no doubt the outcome of a single inspiration.

"The night," says an eye-witness, "was pursuing its normal course,
and as there were no indications of disturbance, Dr. Duguet took the
opportunity to go and get a little rest in the house where he was
living, which was just across the street opposite his ambulance. The
Abbé Le Helloco, chaplain of the 2nd Regiment, had joined him at about
1:30 A.M. The latter admits that he was rather uneasy because
of the earlier skirmish, in which, as was his habit, he had been
unremitting in his ministrations to the wounded. After a few minutes'
talk the two men separated to seek their straw pallets. The Abbé had
been asleep for an hour or two, when he was awakened by shots close at
hand. He roused himself and went to Dr. Duguet, who was already up.
The two did not exchange a word. Simultaneously, without taking the
precaution of extinguishing the lights behind them, they hurried to the
street. Enframed by the lighted doorway, they at once became a target;
a volley brought them down in a moment. Dr. Duguet had been struck by a
bullet in the abdomen; the Abbé was hit in the head, the arm, and the
right thigh. The two bodies were touching each other. 'Abbé,' said Dr.
Duguet, 'we are done for. Give me absolution. I regret....' The Abbé
found strength to lift his heavy arm and to make the sign of the cross
upon his dying comrade. Then he fainted, and this saved him. Neither
he nor Dr. Duguet had understood for the moment what was happening.
Whence had the band of marauders who had struck them down come, and how
had they managed to steal into our lines without being seen? It was a
mystery. This fusillade breaking out behind them had caused a certain
disorder in the sections nearest to it, who thought they were being
taken in the rear, and who would have been, indeed, had the attack
been maintained. The band arrived in front of the ambulance station at
the moment when the staff (three Belgian doctors, a few naval hospital
orderlies, and Quartermaster Bonnet) were attending to Dr. Duguet, who
was still breathing. They made the whole lot prisoners and carried them
along in their idiotic rush through the streets. Both officers and
soldiers must have been drunk. This is the only reasonable explanation
of their mad venture. We held all the approaches to Dixmude; the brief
panic that took place in certain sections had been at once controlled."


IV--STORY OF MURDER OF COMMANDER JEANNIOT

"Commander Jeanniot, who had been in reserve that night, and who,
roused by the firing like Dr. Duguet and Abbé Le Helloco, had gone
into the street to call his sector to arms, had not even taken his
revolver in his hand. Mistaking the identity and the intentions of
the groups he saw advancing, he ran towards them to reassure them and
bring them back to the trenches. This little stout, grizzled officer,
rough and simple in manner, was adored by the sailors. He was known
to be the bravest of the brave, and he himself was conscious of his
power over his men. When he recognized his mistake it was too late.
The Germans seized him, disarmed him, and carried him off with loud
'_Hochs!_' of satisfaction. The band continued to push on towards the
Yser, driving a few fugitives before them, and a part of them succeeded
in crossing the river under cover of the general confusion. Happily
this did not last long. Captain Marcotte de Sainte-Marie, who was in
command of the guard on the bridge, identified the assailants with the
help of a searchlight, and at once opened fire upon them. The majority
of the Germans within range of our machine-guns were mown down; the
rest scattered along the streets and ran to cellars and ruins to
hide themselves. But the head of the column had got across with its
prisoners, whom they drove before them with the butt-ends of their
rifles.[13] For four hours they wandered about, seeking an issue which
would enable them to rejoin their lines. It was raining the whole time.
Weary of wading through the mud, the officers stopped behind a hedge to
hold a council. A pale light began to pierce the mist; day was dawning,
and they could no longer hope to regain the German lines in a body.
Prudence dictated that they should disperse until nightfall. But what
was to be done with the prisoners? The majority voted that they should
be put to death. The Belgian doctors protested. Commander Jeanniot,
who took no part in the debate, was talking calmly to Quartermaster
Bonnet. At a sign from their leader the Boches knelt and opened fire
upon the prisoners. The Commander fell, and as he was still breathing,
they finished him off with their bayonets. The only survivors were the
Belgian doctors, who had been spared, and Quartermaster Bonnet, who had
only been hit in the shoulder. It was at this moment that the marauders
were discovered. One section charged them forthwith; another fell back
to cut off their retreat. What happened afterwards? Some accounts
declare that the German officers learned what it costs to murder
prisoners, and that our men despatched the dogs there and then; but
the truth is, that, in spite of the general desire to avenge Commander
Jeannoit, the whole band was taken prisoners and brought before the
Admiral, who had only the three most prominent rascals of the gang
executed."

people shouting, 'Long live the French!' I heard one person in the
crowd call out, 'Long live Jean Gouin!' He must have known them well."

been corrupted into Gouin, is a very common name in Brittany. [Compare

[13] Here there seems to have been some confusion in the eye-witness's
account. He leads us to suppose that Dr. Duguet's ambulance was in
the town, and that the Germans who killed him and wounded the Abbé
Le Helloco went on afterwards to the bridge with their prisoners.
"As a fact," we are now told, "the affair took place between
the bridge--which the head of a column had crossed by surprise,
driving before them a number of Belgians, sailors, and perhaps some
marauders--and the level crossing near the station of Caeskerke where
the column was finally stopped. It was in this part of the street
that Dr. Duguet had his dressing-station; and it was there, too, that
Commander Jeanniot, whose reserve post was at Caeskerke, came out to
meet the assailants. And it was the fields near the south bank of the
Yser to which the column betook itself, dragging its prisoners with it,
when it found the road barred."




A BISHOP AT THE FRONT WITH THE BRITISH ARMY

_Told by the Right Reverend H. Russell Wakefield, Bishop of Birmingham_

  This is an account of how the Bishop, accompanied by the Lord
  Mayor of Birmingham, went to the fighting lines to visit the staff
  at headquarters. They were at times within thirty-five yards of
  the German trenches. His impressions have been recorded in a
  volume published by _Longmans, Green and Company_, from which the
  following incidents are taken.

[14] I--THE HUMOUR OF BRITISH "TOMMIES"

Whenever, in future, I am inclined towards a fit of pessimism, I
shall shut my eyes in order to see once again, with the vision of the
spirit, a stalwart Britisher of the Worcester Regiment, not very far
from the German lines, on a certain afternoon, when a most appalling
thunderstorm was raging and some German shells were falling. He was
munching the thickest slice of bread and jam that I have ever seen,
and looking with a mild contempt at the intruding figure of an unknown
padre whom a considerable number of his comrades were greeting because
they recognised in him their Bishop. He put down now and again his
refreshment in order to do some bit of work, but he was just as calm
and collected as if he had been in his Worcestershire village and not
in the trenches.

That which carries our men through so many difficulties is another
thing which impressed me--namely, their unfailing sense of humour; a
humour which is never really hurtful even when exercised upon some one
deserving of satire. When he christens a road along which there are
a couple of miles of Army Service carts "Lorry Park," when he finds
every kind of strange anglicising for Flemish or French words, we know
that he is not only having some fun for himself, but also providing
amusement for those who come after him. The same humour shines out when
he is in hard case. A chaplain told me that he had been addressing
informally some wounded men who had just arrived from the trenches.
He was expatiating upon the glories of the Victoria Cross because he
noticed some of the men came from a regiment one of whose number had
recently received that coveted distinction. Suddenly his eloquence was
disturbed by a voice proceeding from a man, both of whose feet were
swathed in bandages, who remarked, "Never mind the Victoria Cross, give
me the Victoria 'Bus!" Obviously the soldier's sense of humour was
conquering his pain, and his remark made the rest of the party forget
their sufferings for a short time....


II--FRANCE BLEEDS FOR CIVILIZATION

As one who saw the French during the war of 1870, when--being a
boy--I was very susceptible to impressions, I can hardly express the
difference I notice between the nation then and now. In the former
war there was excitement, impulsiveness, overconfidence, want of
ballast; to-day there is quietude, earnestness, and withal, assurance
of eventual victory. More than once I journeyed through a considerable
part of the French lines, and I assert with confidence that the Army
of France at the present time is incomparably superior to that which
she placed in the field in 1870. As to her civilians, I only saw women,
children, and old men; I did not, in all my thousand miles of travel,
discover a single able-bodied person of military age out of uniform.

The harvest, a very good one, was in full swing. Every family was out
in the fields, all doing something towards the in-gathering. I have
a picture now before my eyes of seven people, all undoubtedly coming
from the same house, working away hard, whilst at the tail end of the
procession appeared what might have been the great-grandpapa, no longer
capable of bending down for harvesting, but who, nevertheless, had his
piece of work in carrying about the baby, who, of course, could not be
left behind alone in the house. The whole nation is doing its utmost.


III--"HOW I WENT TO THE TRENCHES"

On one occasion after motoring through towns that are a household word,
both at home and with our Allies, towns which have seen the Germans
in them and then driven out of them, places where the buildings are
practically level with the ground, the limit for vehicular traffic is
reached and one goes forward on foot. Soon you reach a cutting in the
ground and you begin to walk along a trench. You turn now and again
either to right or left, seeing sign-posts telling sometimes in comic
language and sometimes only by number the name, as it were, of the
underground street; you then rise a little and find yourself walking
in the inside of houses so shattered that you cannot tell much about
what they originally were until you are told that they formed a street
in a little overgrown village of which nothing is left, and the last
inhabitant of which was the station-master, who refused to leave though
there was neither train, station nor house for himself left, because
so long as he remained on the spot he could claim his pay. Forcible
measures had at last to be used to secure his departure. Where you are
walking you are yourself hidden from the enemy, but are within the
range of their fire. You are taken up to an observation post, where one
of your companions incautiously takes out a white pocket-handkerchief
and is hurriedly told to put it back in his pocket.

You come down again and proceed cautiously along trenches. Now and
again shells pass over, and your careful guide looks to see in what
direction they are falling, as, though he is quite unconcerned for
himself, he knows that he is responsible for the safety of the
troublesome visitor. You are told to keep your head down and not to
show, for the moment at any rate, any desire to view the landscape.
Soldiers are dotted about here and there, all of them ready to give a
kindly greeting, and then at last you reach a point where you are told
not to speak loudly because practically only a few yards away is the
enemy, who, were he to hear conversation, might think it worth while
to throw over a hand grenade. What looks like a tiny bit of glass at
the end of a short stick is there before you, and you are asked to look
into it; when you do the enemies' trenches are visible to you. Beyond
an occasional ping against a sandbag, you have heard nothing to note
the existence of rifle fire, except that the men you have passed have
got these weapons to hand. You tell the men at the advanced posts how
proud their country is of them, how thankful you are to have seen them,
how you pray that God may bring them back safe to their homes; you get
rid of all cigars or cigarettes you may have upon you, wishing that you
had thousands more, and then you return home, varying perhaps the route
through the communication trenches.

On another occasion our way took us through a town which is absolutely
razed to the ground and is still under shell fire. There I saw two
soldiers busy with spades, and I asked what kind of fortification they
were putting up, to which, with a broad grin, one replied that they
were looking for souvenirs. He was kind enough to give me a complete
German cartridge case, for which he refused to take any remuneration.
Going on a little farther in this town, we went down some steps and
found ourselves in an underground club full of soldiers, who were
having a hot meal, were reading papers and playing games, everything
being presided over by perhaps the most magnetic person I met on my
travels, a young Chaplain to the Forces, who would not wish his name
to be mentioned, though there is probably no one out at the Front who
will not know to whom I refer. When we went from this place towards the
more advanced trenches, I was taken along a road which looked perfectly
harmless, when suddenly a stalwart Scotchman told my companion and
myself that we must get off it at once as it was a favourite target
for German Maxims. Never was a General more obediently submitted to than
was this, I believe, private soldier. It was on this occasion that we
had tea in the dugout of the Colonel, who bears a name distinguished
in English naval, military and sporting life. A characteristic of the
German trenches which I noticed on this and other occasions, was that
their sandbags seemed to be generally white in colour, at any rate in
those of the first line. Leaving the trench on this particular day, we
had to go through an almost alarming thunderstorm, which in the course
of half an hour made a sea of mud of the place which had been quite
dry before. It was curious to notice how petty the sound of the guns
appeared as compared with the artillery of heaven.

Pathetic incidents occur and touching scenes are visible on these
journeys to the Front. One looked in the trenches upon little mounds
and crosses, marking the resting-places of men who had been hurriedly,
but reverently, buried. There they are side by side with their living
comrades, who are doing their work whilst their brothers sleep. Dotted
all about the country are little cemeteries, which tell of devotion
unto death, and which remind one of all the sorrow this war has
caused. It is strange to see how religious emblems appear to have been
strong against shell. Constantly you would see a church almost totally
destroyed and yet the crucifix untouched, and who will ever forget that
sight which can be seen for miles around, of the tower which has been
almost shattered to pieces and yet the statue of the Virgin and Child,
which was near the top of it, though bent over completely at right
angles, still remains, as it were blessing and protecting the whole
neighbourhood.


IV--"SEE GOD THRO' CLOUD OF SMOKE"

This leads to the consideration of the religious condition of our
troops as affected, first, by the churches and worshippers of France,
and, secondly, by their own experience in this war. More than one
mentioned the pleasure felt at the sight of the little wayside shrines
which they passed on their march. Others commented upon the large
numbers of people they saw flocking to their early communion....

What his experience of war is doing for the soldier in regard to
religion is remarkable. It would have been possible that the sight of
humanity striving to the death and inflicting horrible suffering might
have made our young fellows despair of Christianity. They might have
argued that it was of no avail to teach the religion of Jesus when no
effect was produced upon international conduct; but they have been
able to look more deeply into matters and to realise that not Divine
intention was at fault, but human refusal to follow true teaching. They
have been able to see God through the cloud of smoke raised by shot
and shell, and the Presence of the Divine has not been obscured by
the horrors of war. Conscious of the seriousness of the work in which
they are engaged, feeling every moment the nearness of eternity, our
soldiers have in no craven spirit, but with a due remembrance of their
relationship to God and to eternity, turned to religion as a stay in
the hour of conflict....

Although I must refrain most reluctantly from saying anything about
the great military personages whom I met in France, and with whom I
was so greatly impressed, I may perhaps refer to two French persons of
distinction, in no way connected with the war, whom I was privileged
to meet. First there is that outstanding personality the Mayor of
Hazebrouck, Abbé Lemire. He and I were brought together because he is a
clerical municipal dignitary and I was the first clergyman who was ever
a mayor in this country. He, however, does more than I have ever been
able to do, because he is a member of the Chamber of Deputies, and here
in England the doors of the House of Commons are still shut against the
clergy....

He is an extraordinarily winning personality, and as we walked through
the streets of his city every woman and child and old man had something
to say to him. With one he would discuss the imprisonment of a soldier
son in Germany; with another the fact that a married daughter had had a
bouncing boy who would be, so prophesied the Abbé, a soldier of France
in years to come. To another in deep mourning he had a word of comfort
to give; until at last I said to him that he appeared to be not only
_le maire_ but also _le père_ of Hazebrouck....

Another beautiful character is the present Archbishop of Rouen.
Carrying well his seventy-six years, thanks in no small measure to the
loving care of his secretary, the great dignitary has passed through
the recent critical time for his Church, retaining throughout his
breadth of view and his sweetness of nature. Turned out of his official
residence, he has built himself another, beautifully situated, in the
grounds of which may to-day be seen English doctors and nurses, and
even wounded, resting and gaining health. The morning upon which I saw
him I had been celebrating the Holy Communion in the chapel of what
once was his palace. When I asked him whether he felt any objection to
this being done by our English clergy, he answered, "Certainly not."
And then, after a moment's thought, he went on: "After all, what does
it matter whether one celebrates in one vestment and another in a
different one, if at the root of things we are the same?"

(The Bishop now relates his impressions of the various countries
engaged in the War, all of which, with the exception of Japan, he has
visited. He believes that the War is to result in a great spiritual
awakening throughout the world.)

SHORT RATIONS--THE TRUTH ABOUT LIFE IN GERMANY

_An American Woman in Germany_

_Told by Madeline Zabriskie Doty_

  Miss Doty made two trips of exploration to Europe during the War.
  She is one of the few "foreigners" who were permitted to visit
  prison camps and industrial factories in Germany. It has remained
  for this American woman to bring out of Germany some of the most
  interesting sidelights. It is a graphic account of the tragedy
  which reveals the conditions within the German Empire. Miss Doty
  talked with the German women in the factories, the mothers with
  their babies, finding everywhere the tragedy of suffering almost
  beyond human endurance. The following reminiscences are from
  her book: "Short Rations," published by the _Century Company_:
  Copyright 1917.

[15] I--STORY OF WOMAN WHO WANTED TO SELL HER CHILD

I awoke to find myself in Germany.... Hamburg is a city of sleepers.
Its big hotels, its many stores, its impressive buildings stretch
out endlessly, but within all is still. All that modern industry
and the ingenuity of man can achieve has here been flung upon the
land, and then the force that created it has vanished, leaving these
great monuments to rot, to rust, and to crumble. The tragedy of
unused treasures is as horrible as rows of dead. A city seems visibly
dying....

A crowd of children is gathering just below. School is out, and they
are surrounding an object of interest. One or two women join them.
There is no passing populace to swell the throng. We approach and see
in the centre of the crowd of children a woman crouched upon a bench.
She is dirty, ragged, and dark in colouring.... On the ground at her
feet is a baby just big enough to walk. It also is dirty, and possesses
only one ragged garment. The mother sits listless, gazing at her
child. It is evident she is soon to be a mother again. There is great
chattering among the children. I turn to my companion for explanation.

"The woman wants to sell her child. She says she hasn't anything to
eat. She isn't a German mother. Of course, no German mother would do
such a thing. You can see she isn't good. She is going to have another
baby."

A school-child gives the toddling baby some cherries. She eats them
greedily. My hand goes to my pocketbook, but my companion pulls me
away. If I bought the baby, what could I do with her on a trip through
Germany?...


II--THE SECRET GRIEF OF GERMANY

But before I leave Germany the spies get on my nerves. What was at
first amusing becomes a nuisance. I feel exactly as though I am in
prison. I acquire the habit of looking out of the corner of my eye
and over my shoulder. These spies are as annoying to their countrymen
as to me. The people detest them. They grow restless under such
suppression. Free conversation is impossible, except behind closed
doors. Between German spies and the spies of other countries supposed
to be at large, public conversation is at a standstill. Everywhere are
signs--"_Soldaten_"--"_Vorsicht bei gespröchen Spionengefahr_."...

In spite of the concealment of the wounded, the population begins to
understand its loss. One night I went to the station (at Berlin) to
see a big detachment leave for Wilmâ. They had all been in war before.
Their uniforms were dirty and patched. They sat on benches clinging
to a loved one's hand, or stood in listless groups. No one talked.
They were like tired children. They needed food and bed. The scenes of
farewell were harrowing.

Here was a young boy saying good-by to a mother and three aunts. He
was all they had--their whole life. Here a father saying farewell to a
wife and three sons, all under seventeen. Or a mother in deep mourning
taking leave of her last son, or a young wife with a baby in her arms
giving a last embrace.

As the train moved out of the station there were no shouts, no cheers,
no words of encouragement. Instead there was a deadly silence. The men
leaned out of windows, stretched despairing hands towards loved ones.
As the train pulled away the little groups broke into strangling sobs.
They were shaken as by a mighty tempest. Paroxysms of grief rent and
tore them. They knew the end had come. A man may go once into battle
and return, but not twice and thrice. Life held no hope. As I came away
I stopped before the big building which conducts military affairs. It
is known as the "House of Sorrow." On its rear wall is posted the list
of dead and wounded....

One evening at midnight as I cross the Thiergarten I pass a small
procession of new recruits. Midnight, my friend tells me, is the
favourite hour for seizing fresh food for cannon. There is something
sinister in choosing dark hours, when the city sleeps, for this
deed....


III--A BEAUTIFUL STORY TOLD IN GENEVA

While in Geneva I visited the Red Cross authorities. This is the
Central Bureau for relief work. It gives aid to the wounded and
prisoners of all the belligerent countries. Many horrible, tragic and
beautiful stories pass through the committee's hands.

After the war these stories will come to light. At present the rigid
censorship prevents publication, for it is impossible to carry printed
or written material across frontiers.

But one story told me needed no notes. It became engraven in my memory.
It is the story of an English boy and a German mother.

I could not secure the letters that passed between these two but their
contents, and the other facts given are here set forth accurately. This
is a true story.

       *       *       *       *       *

The sky was a soft, shining blue. The air was still. The warmth of
summer brooded over the land. But no bird's song broke the stillness.
No bees fluttered over flowers. The earth lay torn and bare. In deep
brown furrows of the earth, hundreds of restless men lay or knelt or
stood.

The land was vibrant with living silence. But now and again a gigantic
smashing roar broke the tense stillness. Then in some spots, the ground
spit forth masses of dirt, a soldier's helmet, a tattered rag of
uniform, and bits of a human body.

It was after such a mighty blast that a great winged object came
speeding from the north. It skimmed low over the trenches and dipped,
and circled and paused above the English line. Like a great eagle it
seemed about to rush to earth, snatch its prey, and then be off. But
as it hung suspended, another whirring monster flew swiftly from
the south. It winged its way above its rival, then turning, plunged
downward. The great cannons grew silent. The eyes of the pigmies in
the trenches gazed skyward. A breathless tenseness gripped the earth.
Only sun and sky shone on with no whisper of the mad fight of these two
winged things.

For a few wild moments they rushed at one another. Then the whirring
bird with wings of white rose high, turned back, and plunged again upon
that other whose wings had huge, black crosses.

It missed its prey, but there came a cracking sound. A puff of smoke,
like a hot breath, burst from the creature of the iron crosses. It
shuddered, dropped, turned, and fell head down. With sweeping curves
the pursuer also came to earth. A lean, young Englishman sprang from
the whirring engine. His body quivered with excitement. He sped with
running feet to the broken object lying on the ground. He knelt by the
twisted mass. Beneath the splintered wood and iron he saw a boyish
figure. It was still and motionless. He gently pulled the body out. A
fair young German lay before him. A deep gash in the head showed where
a blow had brought instant death. The body was straight and supple,
the features clear cut and clean. A boy's face with frank and fearless
brow looked up at the young Englishman. The eyes held no malice. They
were full of shocked surprise. The brown haired lad felt the lifeless
heart. A piece of cardboard met his fingers. He pulled it from the coat
pocket. It was a picture--a picture of a woman--a woman with gray hair
and kindly eyes,--a mother whose face bore lines of patient suffering.
Scrawled beneath the portrait in boyish hand were the words, "Meine
Mutter."

A sob choked the young Englishman. Tenderly he gathered the lifeless
form in his strong arms. Then he rose and walked unheeding across the
open field of battle. But no angry bullet pelted after those young
figures. The men in the trenches saw and understood. Behind the lines
the boy lay his burden down. Taking paper and pencil from his pocket
and placing the little picture before him, he began to write.

When he had finished he placed the letter and portrait in a carefully
directed envelope. Then walking hurriedly to his machine he prepared
for flight. Soon he was whirring low over the enemy trenches. Leaning
out, he dropped his missile. The cannons roared, but no rifle was
turned on that bright figure. Instinctively, men knew his deed was
one of mercy. As the little paper fluttered downward it was picked up
by eager soldier hands. A little cheer broke from a hundred throats.
Willing messengers passed it to the rear. Speedily it went on its way.

Twenty-four hours later a mother with pale face and trembling hands
fingered the white scrap of paper. Her unseeing eyes gazed out on a
smiling landscape. Between green meadows in the warm summer sunshine
lay the glittering Rhine. But she saw nothing. Her baby boy was dead.
Memories of him flooded her. She felt again the warmth of the baby body
as it clung to hers and the pull of the tiny hands at her breast. She
saw him as a boy, his eager restlessness. She heard his running steps
at the door and his cry of "mother." It was over. That bright spirit
was still. The third and last son had been exacted. Her fingers touched
the letter in her lap. Her eyes fell on the penciled words. Slowly they
took meaning. This boy who wrote: He'd seen the beauty of her son. He'd
lifted the dear body in his arms. His heart was torn by anguish. What
was it he said?


IV--WHAT THE GERMAN MOTHER READ ON THE SCRAP OF PAPER

  "'It's your son. I know you can't forgive me for I killed him. But
  I want you to know he didn't suffer. The end came quickly. He was
  very brave. He must also have been very good. He had your picture
  in his pocket. I am sending it back, though I should like to keep
  it. I suppose I am his enemy, yet I don't feel so at all. I'd give
  my life to have him back. I didn't think of him or you when I shot
  at his machine. He was an enemy spying out our men. I couldn't let
  him get back to tell his news. It meant death to our men. It was a
  plucky deed. We were covered up with brush. He had to come quite
  low to see us and he came bravely. He nearly escaped me. He handled
  his machine magnificently. I thought how I should like to fly with
  him. But he was the enemy and had to be destroyed. I fired. It was
  over in a second. Just a blow on the head as the machine crashed to
  earth. His face shows no suffering, only excitement. His eyes are
  bright and fearless. I know you must have loved him. My mother died
  when I was quite a little boy. But I know what she would have felt
  if I had been killed. War isn't fair to women. God! how I wish it
  were over. It is a nightmare. I feel if I just touched your boy,
  he'd wake and we'd be friends. I know his body must be dear to you.
  I will take care of it and mark his grave with a little cross.
  After the war you may want to take him home.

  "'For the first time, I'm almost glad my mother isn't living. She
  could not have borne what I have done. My own heart is heavy. I
  felt it was my duty. Yet now when I see your son lifeless before me
  and hold your picture in my hand, it all seems wrong. The world is
  dark. O Mother, be my mother just a little too, and tell me what to
  do.--HUGH.'"

Slowly great tears rolled down the woman's cheeks. What was this
monster that was smashing men? Her boy and this other, they were the
same. No hate was in their hearts. They suffered--the whole world
suffered. Her country went in hunger. The babies in the nearby cottages
grew weak for want of milk. She mustn't tell that to the English lad.
His heart would break. Why must such suffering be? Was she to blame?
There was the English lad without a mother. She had not thought of him
and others like him. Her home, her sons, her Fatherland, these had been
sufficient. But each life hangs on every other. Motherhood is universal.


V--A GERMAN MOTHER TO THE ENGLISH BOY WHO KILLED HER SON

Suddenly she knew what to write. What she must say to that
grief-stricken English boy. Quickly her hand penned the words:

  "DEAR LAD: There is nothing to forgive. I see you as you
  are--your troubled goodness. I feel you coming to me like a little
  boy astounded at having done ill when you meant well. You seem my
  son. I am glad your hands cared for my other boy. I had rather
  you than any other touched his earthly body. He was my youngest.
  I think you saw his fineness. I know the torture of your heart
  since you have slain him. To women brotherhood is a reality. For
  all men are our sons. That makes war a monster that brother must
  slay brother. Yet perhaps women more than men have been to blame
  for this world war. We did not think of the world's children, our
  children. The baby hands that clutched our breast were so sweet, we
  forgot the hundred other baby hands stretched out to us. But the
  Earth does not forget, she mothers all. And now my heart aches with
  repentance. I long to take you in my arms and lay your head upon my
  breast to make you feel through me your kinship with all the earth.
  Help me, my son, I need you. Be your vision, my vision. Spread the
  dream of oneness and love throughout the land. When the war is over
  come to me. I am waiting for you.--DEINE MUTTER."

FIGHTING "WITH THE RUSSIAN ARMY"--ON AUSTRIAN FRONT

_The Colossal Struggle of the Slavs_

_Told by Bernard Pares, Official Observer with the Russian Army_

  This is one of the most important narratives in the records of
  the War; it is an invaluable witness of the colossal struggle
  waged on the Eastern battle front. The author was granted official
  privileges awarded to no other non-combatant. He passed through
  the first Warsaw Campaign, the crucial battle of Dunajec, and
  the Russian retreat. When Germany declared war on Russia, he
  volunteered for service and went to Petrograd and Moscow, where
  he was appointed official correspondent with the Russian Army,
  traveling with the general staff. He later joined the third army
  as an attaché. Here he was given written permit by General Radko
  Dmitriev to visit any part of the firing line. "We were the advance
  guard," he says, "of the liberation of the Slavs ... the retreat of
  the army to the San and to the Province of Lublin. We were driven
  out by sheer weight of metal ... it was a delight to be with such
  splendid men as the Staff of the Russian Army. I never saw anything
  base all the while I was with the Army. There was no drunkenness,
  everyone was at his best, and it was the simplest and noblest
  atmosphere in which I have ever lived." His experiences have been
  gathered into a volume entitled, "Day by Day With the Russian
  Army," from which the following incidents are retold by permission
  of his American publishers, Houghton, Mifflin and Company.

[16] I--WAR STORIES FROM THE RUSSIANS

It is wonderful how little effect the war seems to have made on the
body of Russia. On the other hand, the atmosphere of nervous tension
begins to disappear the moment one begins to get really near to the
front. In the Red Cross offices at Kiev I found the same straining
toward the front as elsewhere, only much calmer because these were
people who had a big war work to do. Hospitals meet the eye in the
streets at every turn.

Once in the train for Galicia it was again the war atmosphere and
simplicity itself. The talk was all of people engaged directly or
indirectly in it. A graceful old lady with a very attentive son was on
her way to get a sight of her husband, one of the generals. A young
officer, whose wound has kept him out of it for three weeks, is on his
way to the front before Cracow. A fresh-looking young man, at first
unrecognisable to his friends with his close-cropped bullet head,
tells how he went on a reconnaissance, how he came on the Austrians,
how their first line held up their muskets and when the Russians had
passed on fired on their rear, how nevertheless practically all came
back safe and sound. It was told with a kind of schoolboy ingenuousness
and without suggestion or comment of any kind on the conduct of those
concerned. Then followed an account of a war marriage, at first put off
and then carried out as quietly as possible. All the friends of every
one seemed to be at the war.

At the old frontier some of the buildings near the station were wrecked
by artillery fire, and the railway was lined with a succession of solid
hospital barracks, with the local commandant's flag flying over one of
them. There was plenty to eat at the station; and though we moved on
very quickly, every one from our crowded train managed to find a place
in the Austrian carriages, chiefly because every one was ready to help
his neighbour. The corridors jammed with passengers and kits, we moved
on through the typical "strips" of Russian peasant culture, a pleasant
wooded country, passing a draft detachment on the halt which waved
greetings to us. My companion, Mr. Stakhovich, a phenomenally strong
man and imbued by a fine spirit, was talking of the indifference of the
Russian peasant to danger; he regarded it as an indifference to all
sensations; anyhow they go forward, whatever the conditions, as a sheer
matter of course. With the ordinary educated man the mind must be kept
occupied with work if unpleasant possibilities of all kinds are to be
kept out of it; but General Radko Dmitriev, to whom we are going, will
jump up from a meal, however hungry, when there is a chance of getting
under fire.
